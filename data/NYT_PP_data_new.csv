The mayor of San Antonio declared a public health emergency from coronavirus in the second-most populous city in Texas on Monday, days after a woman who had been quarantined and then released into the city later tested positive. The declaration issued by the mayor, Ron Nirenberg, states that no previously quarantined person is allowed to enter the city until further notice. The move will delay the release of dozens of people who have been quarantined at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio and comes after the C.D.C. mistakenly released the woman on Saturday; she went to a hotel and shopping mall before being quarantined again. State officials, including Gov. Greg Abbott, called on federal authorities to provide a written rationale for releasing people from quarantine and to increase the testing protocol from two consecutive negative test results to three. After the infected person had been released on Saturday by the C.D.C. following two negative test results, the results of a third test were received, showing that she tested weakly positive. San Antonio health officials said that the risk of exposure to the public was low and that the patient interacted with very few people. Dozens of quarantined people who had been evacuated from the Diamond Princess luxury cruise ship in Japan were set to be released from Lackland on Monday. The delay was a source of frustration for many of them. Carol Montgomery and her husband, John, were packed and ready at 6:30 a.m for their final temperature check at Lackland on Monday morning, eager to leave after 25 days of quarantine, first aboard the cruise ship and then at the San Antonio base. But a C.D.C. official told them in a conference call that their release would be delayed. Were probably the safest people to be out there right now, said Ms. Montgomery, 67.

The head of the World Health Organization said on Monday that the coronavirus could still be contained around the world, but that the window of opportunity is narrowing. Asked at a news conference about concerns that the virus was no longer containable, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the organization, said the W.H.O.s message has remained consistent: Countries should take a comprehensive approach that tries to contain the virus. Of course we can have concerns and worries, its understandable, but lets really calm down and do the right things, and use the window of opportunity to contain this outbreak, he said. He added, without identifying countries, that in some places we are not seeing the level of response that we expected. For that reason, he said, the W.H.O. was reminding the world that the window of opportunity is narrowing and that we still have to do our best to catch up. Dr. Tedros said there were positive signals that nations could contain the virus, such as the dozens of countries with fewer than 100 cases. He also cited the slowdown of infections in China as a sign that the virus could be contained. There is a point in any epidemic where you believe you can no longer contain the virus, or like it was influenza and you have to shift your resources to saving lives, said Dr. Michael Ryan, the executive director of the W.H.O.s health emergencies program.

The coronavirus and the flu are often compared these days. But what are their ?. So far, the coronavirus seems to be deadlier. On average, the seasonal flu strain kills about 0.1 percent of people who become infected. Early estimates of the death rate in the coronavirus outbreaks epicenter in Wuhan, China, have been around 2 percent. The rate could fall if it turns out that many cases arent detected because they are so mild or even symptom-free. As with influenza, the coronavirus is most dangerous to people over the age of 65, or who have chronic illness or a weak immune system. So far in the current season, the flu has sickened more people than the coronavirus. In the United States, there have been 32 million cases of flu, several hundred thousands of hospitalizations and 18,000 deaths, according to the C.D.C. By contrast, about 100 people in the United States have been infected with the new coronavirus, and there have been two deaths. One area where the two ailments diverge is treatment. There is no approved antiviral drug for the coronavirus, but several are being tested. For those infected with any viral illness, doctors recommend rest, medicine to reduce pain and fever, and fluids to avoid dehydration. For the flu, doctors can offer and they tend to work best within a day or two of when symptoms start. There are no coronavirus vaccinations available, but one may be available in a year or two. Flu vaccines are widely available and generally 40 percent to 60 percent effective. FLU VS. CORONAVIRUS. Here is our story looking at .

Vice President Mike Pence said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was lifting all restrictions on testing for coronavirus, and would be releasing new guidelines to fast-track testing for people who fear they have the virus, even if they are displaying mild symptoms. Today we will issue new guidance from the C.D.C. that will make it clear that any American can be tested, no restrictions, subject to doctors orders, Mr. Pence told reporters at the White House. The federal government has promised to significantly ramp up testing, after drawing criticism for strictly limiting testing in the first weeks of the outbreak. But health care supply companies and public health officials have cast doubt on the governments assurances, as complaints continue that the need for testing remains far greater than the capacity. The estimates were getting from industry right now by the end of this week, close to a million tests will be able to be performed, the head of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Stephen Hahn, said at a White House briefing on Monday. But some companies developing tests say their products are still weeks away from approval. And even if a million test kits were available, public health laboratories say they would not be able to process nearly that many within a week. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services said on Monday that public health labs currently can test 15,000 people daily, though that figure is expected to grow. The F.D.A. said that Dr. Hahn was taking into account the anticipated increased production of test kits by an outside manufacturer, Integrated DNA Technologies, which is now selling kits to the federal government and other buyers.

In response to the epidemic, the government of India on Tuesday curbed exports of 26 drugs and drug ingredients, including a wide range of antibiotics and certain vitamins, meaning that the new coronavirus could soon have ripple effects on people worldwide with other ailments. The world relies heavily on Indias huge pharmaceutical industry for generic drugs, but Indian officials are concerned about safeguarding the supply for their own country. Indian drug makers depend on Chinese factories for key drug ingredients, particularly for antibiotics and vitamins. The Covid-19 outbreak in China and quarantine of Hubei province, where much of the production is centered, has severely hampered Chinas ability to produce those ingredients. Although Indian companies had stockpiled extra ingredients ahead of the annual Lunar New Year holiday, those reserves are now running low. Its unclear whether Indias exports of the specified drugs will be completely stopped. The governments order said that exports of the drugs are restricted, which means a government permit is required before they can be shipped out of the country. The antibiotics facing export limits are tinidazole, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, erythromycin salts, neomycin, clindamycin salts and ornidazole. Other drugs on the restricted list include the painkiller acetaminophen, the hormone progesterone, the antiviral drug aciclovir, and the vitamins B1, B6 and B12. INDIAS DRUG SUPPLY.

An employee at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire who showed signs of possible coronavirus infection was told by a medical worker last week to avoid contact with other people, pending test results. Instead, the man who had flu-like symptoms after a trip to Italy, attended a mixer for doctors and Dartmouth College students. Three days later, he was confirmed as the states first coronavirus case. A close contact of the man has since tested positive as well. The episode heightened concerns about people who ignore requests to self-quarantine. The state health commissioner has now made the request a formal order. Students learned of the possible exposure in an email sent out by the university on Tuesday, saying the man had attended the mixer at the colleges Tuck School of Business on Feb. 28. The college said an investigation was underway. The general vibe is we are all pretty concerned that this medical professional showed up to the event, despite being told to self-isolate, said Christie Harrison, a first-year Tuck student who sang with the band that performed at the mixer.

A tenth person in Washington State has died from the coronavirus and several new infections have been confirmed, officials said on Wednesday, as ramped-up testing offered troubling evidence of how widely the virus had spread. The Seattle area was grappling to contain a worsening crisis that has seen the virus overrun a suburban nursing home, killing at least seven residents. Ten of the 11 confirmed U.S. deaths so far have occurred in Washington, and all have been reported in the last few days. The regions medical resources are under incredible stress right now, said Patty Hayes, director of public health for Seattle and King County. We need to slow the spread of disease to the point where our health care system can continue to handle the load. The county executive, Dow Constantine, said officials are recommending that older residents with underlying health problems stay home, that employers have workers telecommute, and that community organizations cancel events with more than 10 people.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday , allowing doctors to order a test for any patients who have symptoms like fever, cough or difficulty breathing. Doctors were encouraged to first rule out other causes of respiratory illness, like influenza, and to take into consideration whether there are other local coronavirus cases, officials said. Even so, the new standard greatly expands the pool of patients who qualify for testing, though the laboratory capacity to process the tests remains limited. The change could relieve some of the frustration of patients and doctors who have been denied access to the test when they thought it was warranted. Previous guidelines required a patient to have symptoms of respiratory illness as well as a clear risk factor for exposure, like recent travel to China or a number of other affected countries, contact with a known coronavirus patient, or hospitalization with a severe and unexplained respiratory illness. Experts said they feared a rush by the worried well who may flood the health care system, just as new private and hospital labs are gearing up for testing. The federal government had promised to ramp up testing, but some companies and public health officials cast doubt on the governments assurances. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services said on Monday that the labs currently could handle 15,000 tests a day, though that figure was expected to grow. TESTING DELAYS. Public and private labs say they are . Trump tries to shift blame to a favorite target: Obama. President Trump at a meeting at the White House on Wednesday.Credit...Doug Mills/The New York Times. With his administration under fire for its handling of the outbreak, President Trump sought to deflect criticism onto his predecessor on Wednesday, complaining that a federal regulation adopted under President Barack Obama made it harder to do widespread testing for the virus. The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what were doing, and we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place at a much more accurate and rapid fashion, Mr. Trump said during a White House meeting with airline executives. That was a decision we disagreed with, he added. I dont think we would have made it, but for some reason it was made. He appeared to be referring to a regulation that limited the ability of laboratories run by states, universities and private companies to conduct medical screenings not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. On Saturday, the F.D.A. commissioner, Stephen M. Hahn, allowed those labs to use coronavirus tests they had developed independently, after submitting evidence that the tests work. The government has stumbled several times in trying to keep up with the demand for coronavirus tests. Local health agencies and doctors have complained that a lack of tests have hindered their abilities to identify patients. The C.D.C. at first maintained tight control on test production, and some of the early tests it sent to state health departments were defective. The C.D.C. kept equally tight restrictions on who could be tested, but those have been eased significantly. TRUMP RESPONSE.

Nine people connected to the man who was confirmed as of the new coronavirus have all tested positive for the illness, state officials said on Wednesday. The new cases included the mans wife; his son, 20; his daughter, 14; and a neighbor in New Rochelle, N.Y., a Westchester County suburb, who drove the man to the hospital. A friend of the man who spent time in close proximity with him also tested positive for the virus, as did that mans wife and three of their children, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said. The discovery that the Westchester father, a man of about 50 who works with his wife at a law firm in Manhattan, had the illness set off a search by health officials across the region to determine whether he had infected others, and who might have infected him. So far, about 1,000 people were being asked to self-quarantine, Mr. Cuomo estimated. The Westchester mans son is a student at Yeshiva University. Classes at the universitys campus in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan will be canceled until Friday, Mr. Cuomo said. New York Law School in TriBeCa also canceled classes and closed its facilities after a student there reported having contact with the Westchester man. The governor said that about 300 students and faculty members from various State University of New York and City University campuses who are in China, Japan, Iran, or South Korea countries where the illness is raging have been asked to return to New York, and remain in quarantine for two weeks. The New York authorities announced the states first confirmed case of the virus on Sunday, saying that a health care worker had been infected in Iran. She began exhibiting symptoms after returning home but had kept herself largely isolated. Her husband has tested negative for the virus, Mr. Cuomo said.

In Italy, site of by far the biggest outbreak in Europe, the number of infections and deaths surged again on Wednesday, and the country ordered all schools shut down from Thursday until at least March 15. The number of deaths in Italy that the government has attributed to the coronavirus jumped from 79 on Tuesday to 107 on Wednesday more than in any country but China, where the epidemic began. Italys people are the oldest in Europe 23 percent of the population is 65 or over and most of the victims have been elderly. Italian officials reported 3,089 people infected so far up more than 400 from Tuesday a figure surpassed only in China and South Korea. Italy has 295 coronavirus patients in intensive care, and the health care system in parts of Lombardy, the northern region that has been hardest hit, is straining under the burden. The authorities put two more towns under lockdown on Wednesday, raising the total to 13. The school closure, announced by Education Minister Lucia Azzolini, affects everything from day care through universities. It was not an easy decision to make, she said. Just as many of the early outbreaks around the world traced back to travel in China, many others, particularly in Europe, are linked to travel in Italy. The next-largest outbreaks on the continent are in France, with 285 cases reported by Wednesday; Germany, with 240; and Spain, with 193. One of the sharpest increases was in Britain, which reported 87 cases, up from 51 on Tuesday. Poland recorded its first infection, in a person who had recently traveled to Germany. In Spain, officials said they believe the death from pneumonia of a 69-year-old man in Valencia on Feb. 13 was the earliest known fatality in Europe connected to Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The announcement suggests that the virus was circulating in Spain earlier than previously believed. ITALY IN CRISIS. The virus is deadlier than the seasonal flu but may not transmit as easily, the W.H.O. says.

Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, is much deadlier than seasonal flu but may not spread as easily, World Health Organization officials have reiterated. But their statements also reinforced how much efforts to quantify the epidemic remain little more than rough estimates. Among people who catch seasonal flus, about 0.1 to 0.2 percent die from the illness, though the number varies widely from year to year, depending on the strain of the virus and other factors. It has been apparent since January that the new virus had a significantly higher fatality rate though lower than those of other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS. Globally, about 3.4 percent of reported Covid-19 cases have died, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.s director general, said on Tuesday at a news conference in Geneva. But the figure came loaded with caveats. Experts, including those at the W.H.O., say that when more is known about the epidemic, the death rate will be considerably lower. The death rate Dr. Tedros cited does not include mild cases that were not detected because people did not seek medical attention. And it primarily reflects the experience in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the epidemic began and where the numbers soared before Chinas medical systems had gathered the knowledge and marshaled the resources to fight it. Earlier estimates of the mortality rate in China had been closer to 2 percent. Dr. Bruce Aylward, who is leading the W.H.O.s coronavirus efforts, said he expects that ultimately, it will turn out to be between 1 and 2 percent. And it could be below 1 percent, according Dr. Anthony S. Fauci and Dr. H. Clifford Lane, of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Robert R. Redfield, director of the C.D.C. The extent and mortality of the epidemic will not be known with great accuracy until a reliable test is developed for the antibodies present in people who have been infected, and that test is administered to large numbers of people.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Senate resoundingly approved $8.3 billion in emergency aid on Thursday to counter the spread of the coronavirus, sending the package for President Trumps expected signature, even as nurses in two of the hardest-hit states warned of a lack of equipment and training. The bipartisan package includes nearly $7.8 billion for agencies dealing with the virus, like state and local health departments that say that even as they deal with early-stage outbreaks, their resources are strained. It also authorizes $500 million to encourage Medicare providers for telehealth services for the elderly at home. Nurses in Washington State and California said they need to care for coronavirus patients and training in how to use it, as well as clear protocols to keep themselves and their patients safe. Health care workers are among the groups most at risk of contracting the virus. At least eight people who work in health care facilities in the United States have been diagnosed with coronavirus. Some nurses said that instead of in-person training, they had been asked to watch online videos about how to spot the virus and how to put on and take off hazmat suits. Others said they had been forced to beg for N95 masks, which are thicker and block out much smaller particles than surgical masks do. And still others said they had faced ridicule when expressing concerns about catching the highly contagious virus.

The difficulty of calculating the viruss fatality rate. With the numbers of coronavirus cases soaring and experts putting out varying estimates of death rates, it can be hard to keep track of what all the numbers mean. To help, an editor on our science team, James Gorman, tracked down a mathematician who uses math to understand outbreaks of diseases like Ebola, SARS, influenza and now the coronavirus, or Covid-19: at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Here are selections from their edited, condensed . Dr. Adam Kucharski.Credit...Tom Jamieson for The New York Times. To understand the case fatality rate, can we just look at the total number of deaths and the current number of cases?. The problem with just dividing the total number of deaths by the total number of cases is that it doesnt account for unreported cases or the delay from illness to death. The delay is crucial: If 100 people arrive at hospital with Covid-19 on a given day, and all are currently still alive, it obviously doesnt mean that the fatality rate is 0 percent. We need to wait until we know what happens to them eventually. Any deaths will be people who got sick two to three weeks ago, so its not simply deaths at the moment divided by cases at the moment. Plus some cases might be missed. Does the latest estimate of a 3.4 percent fatality rate globally make sense?. Early on, people looked at total current cases and deaths, which, as I said, is a flawed calculation, and concluded that the case fatality rate must be 2 percent based on China data. If you run the same calculation on yesterdays totals for China, you get an apparent CFR  of near 4 percent. People are speculating that something is happening with the virus, where it actually is just this statistical illusion that weve known about from Day 1. Id say on best available data, when we adjust for unreported cases and the various delays involved, were probably looking at a fatality risk of probably between maybe 0.5 and 2 percent for people with symptoms.

The epidemic in Europe will probably get much worse before it is contained, officials warned on Thursday, as the number of infections across the continent jumped sharply, from fewer than 4,000 on Wednesday to well over 5,000, with at least 160 deaths. Its now highly likely that the virus is going to spread in a significant way, said a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, where the number of cases rose from 87 to 115. Dilek Kalayci, the local health minister in Berlin, said: We must accept that this will continue and we will have more new cases confirmed. No one is able to stop this from spreading. In the hardest-hit European countries, the number of cases saw the biggest one-day jumps so far: from 3,089 to 3,858 in Italy; from 262 to 482 in Germany; and from 285 to 423 in France. In Netherlands, infections more than doubled, from 38 to 82. The death toll in Italy, the source of outbreaks in several other countries, leapt from 107 to 148, the highest figure outside of China. Britain and Switzerland reported their first coronavirus deaths on Thursday, and Spain had its second.

VIRUS IN ITALY. as the virus spreads. Immigration enforcement clashes with virus containment, Democrats say. The Trump administrations efforts to contain the new coronavirus may be running headlong into its simultaneous crackdown on illegal immigration, Democrats warned. Immigration and Customs Enforcement this week began 24-hour-a-day surveillance operations around the homes and workplaces of people believed to be undocumented immigrants, and the agency plans to deploy hundreds of additional officers in unmarked cars in the coming weeks. Senate Democrats on Thursday sought assurances from Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, that his department would not interfere with undocumented immigrants seeking medical attention. This is a public health and safety issue that, if anything else, puts all of our communities at risk, Senator Jacky Rosen, Democrat of Nevada, said. Will the department refrain from apprehending individuals based solely on their immigration status while theyre seeking care?. Mr. Cuccinelli said ICE does not conduct enforcement at health care facilities absent single case exigent circumstances. But immigrant advocates say that stepped-up enforcement could deter people from seeking medical care. On Wednesday, nine Democratic senators and members of his coronavirus task force urging the agency to halt civil immigration enforcement in or around health care facilities. The senators also requested that Homeland Security publicly state that the administrations new wealth test, known as the public charge rule, would not penalize immigrants who receive treatment for coronavirus symptoms by labeling them public charges, thus barring their paths to green cards.

The 34th annual edition of South by Southwest, the annual festival of music, film and technology in Austin that has become a global draw, was ordered canceled on Friday by local officials over fears about the spread of coronavirus. Festival organizers and government officials had come under intense pressure in recent days to pull the plug, with more than 50,000 people signing an online petition and a growing list of tech companies among them Apple, Facebook, Twitter and TikTok announcing their withdrawal. The festival was to have run from March 13-22, with events spread across bars and party spaces in Austin, in addition to the main conference activities. The cancellation is perhaps the largest collateral damage of the virus so far on the international cultural calendar. Last year, South by Southwests various events had a combined attendance of 417,000, including 159,000 who came to the music portion, according to . Two other large-scale, multi-day gatherings were also called off or pushed back on Friday: Emerald City Comic Con, a convention that draws thousands of people to Seattle each year, was postponed until the summer; and the Ultra Music Festival, an electronic dance music event held annually in Miami, where city officials blocked the event from going on.

A spokeswoman for the Association of Public Health Laboratories, Michelle Forman, said there were about 72 public health laboratories that are presently testing for the new coronavirus.

Yields move inversely to bond prices, and their slide has come as investors have fled risky investments and put their money into low-interest but safe Treasury bonds.

China also recorded 24 cases in people who had arrived from abroad, including 17 in Gansu, a northwest Chinese province. Excluding the infections in Wuhan and among arrivals from abroad, there was only one other new infection in the rest of China on Friday. China also reported 28 deaths among those with the virus, all in Hubei Province. That was fewer than , where there were 49 deaths on Friday. The downward trend in China is a result of an all-out effort by the government to contain the spread of the disease. Since January, the government has enacted nationwide quarantine and travel restrictions and placed Hubei under a strict lockdown, effectively penning in 56 million people. The new numbers reflect a steep decline from just a few weeks earlier. At one point in early February, Hubei reported more than 1,400 new cases outside Wuhan in one day. One of the government-appointed Chinese researchers working to control the outbreak told the state-run newspaper Peoples Daily on Thursday that, based on the data, he expected Wuhan to hit zero new infections later this month. But the harsh restrictions have also frustrated ordinary Chinese people, especially in Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak.

Russia, if official figures are to be believed, has waged one of the worlds most successful campaigns to halt the spread of the coronavirus, reporting just 10 cases across a vast country with 11 time zones and a border with China more than 2,600 miles long. So it came as a surprise this week when the city authorities in Moscow suddenly announced a raft of sweeping precautionary measures. In a decree published late Wednesday, the capitals mayor, Sergei S. Sobyanin, ordered all residents who visit China, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, South Korea or other unspecified states with an unfavorable coronavirus situation to report to the municipal government upon their return to Moscow and to self-isolate for two weeks. The United States has now been added to the list. Mr. Sobyanins decree, which declared a regime of heightened readiness for the capital, created uncertainty and dismay rather than reassurance, raising questions about why a city with just five officially reported cases had suddenly instituted such stringent controls.

Egypts health minister announced 33 new infections on a quarantined Nile cruise boat on Sunday, including foreign tourists and Egyptian crew members, bringing to 45 the number onboard who have tested positive. The boat, which local media said was named A Sara, is docked at Luxor near the famous Valley of the Kings, one of the Middle Easts most popular tourist attractions. A vacationing Taiwanese-American woman who took a trip on the boat in late January tested positive in Taiwan weeks later, drawing the World Health Organization to retrace her travels. The long gap between infection and detection on the cruiser raises the possibility that the coronavirus could have been transmitted to several groups of tourists, foreign and domestic, during the month of February. Typically, Nile cruise ships travel along the river between the cities of Luxor and Aswan for two or three nights, stopping at ancient temples along the river. In the past week, at least 26 foreign tourists have tested positive after returning home from Egypt, mostly to the United States, France and Greece. Of those, at least three are confirmed to have traveled on the quarantined cruiser the Taiwanese-American woman and a husband and wife from California, who have since been hospitalized.

What everyone wants to know: Whats the fatality rate?. A woman infected with the coronavirus was brought to the University of Nebraska Medical Center in an isolation pod on Friday.Credit...Chris Machian/Omaha World-Herald, via Associated Press. Understanding how deadly the coronavirus can be is a central factor for governments to gauge how drastic their countermeasures should be and for individuals to adjust their own anxiety. But the real rate is elusive. The World Health Organizations estimate this week of 3.4 percent seemed to shock experts, some of whom said that 1 percent was more realistic. There are several reasons we still dont know the right number. Not enough people have been tested. Incomplete testing means the reported death rates probably skew high; if many more cases were detected, the rates would fall. Until this week, people in the United States were only tested if they had traveled to China or had contact with other ill people. We now know that there were many infected people in the country who werent being counted. The number of coronavirus deaths could also be incomplete. Cases where infected people died without being tested might be missed. And people can be infected for a long time before becoming sick enough to be at risk of death which can throw off a short-term calculation. The rate wont be the same everywhere. Experts say differences in populations and health systems can raise or lower the death rate by country. For example, there is strong evidence that older people are at a higher risk of dying, so countries with more elderly may end up with a higher rate.

Nadine Dorries, the British health minister, confirmed reports late on Tuesday that she had tested positive for the coronavirus. She had attended a reception at Prime Minister Boris Johnsons official residence two days earlier. Ms. Dorries said in a post on Twitter that she had felt pretty rubbish but hoped that the worst of the viral illness had come and gone. British news reports said she was the first member of Parliament to test positive. Health officials were rushing to trace her contacts, which included dozens of constituents and lawmakers, as well as co-workers at the Department of Health and Social Care, according to British news outlets. She was at 10 Downing Street, Mr. Johnsons residence, on Sunday for International Womens Day. The news sparked discussion about whether Parliament would need to be suspended.

Ms. Dorries started feeling ill on Friday as she was signing a statutory instrument that declared coronavirus to be a notifiable disease, a step that allowed British companies to obtain insurance coverage. Some observers noted that Ms. Dorries appeared to have voted in the House of Commons about a week ago, meaning she had at least brief contact with other lawmakers at a time when she may have been contagious. But her most dangerous contact may have been with her 84-year-old mother, who is staying with her, Ms. Dorries wrote on Twitter late Tuesday night.

Delays in testing set back the U.S. coronavirus response. Dr. Helen Y. Chu, an infectious disease expert in Seattle, wanted to repurpose tests from a flu research project to monitor the coronavirus after the first confirmed American case landed in her area in late January. But nearly everywhere she turned, state and federal officials repeatedly rejected the idea, interviews and emails show, even as weeks crawled by and outbreaks emerged in countries outside of China, where the infection began. By Feb. 25, Dr. Chu and her colleagues could not bear to wait any longer. They began performing coronavirus tests, without government approval. What came back confirmed their worst fear. They quickly had a positive test from a local teenager with no recent travel history. The coronavirus had already established itself on American soil without anybody realizing it.

Federal and state officials said the flu study could not be repurposed because it did not have explicit permission from research subjects; the labs were also not certified for clinical work. While acknowledging the ethical questions, Dr. Chu and others argued there should be more flexibility in an emergency during which so many lives could be lost. On Monday night, state regulators told them to stop testing altogether. The failure to tap into the flu study was just one in a series of missed chances by the federal government to ensure more widespread testing during the early days of the outbreak, when containment would have been easier.

The last pandemic declared by the W.H.O. was in 2009, for a new strain of H1N1 influenza.

Senators aide has first confirmed case on Capitol Hill. An aide working in the Washington office of Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington State, has been diagnosed with the coronavirus, according to a statement from her office, becoming the first confirmed case of the virus on Capitol Hill. The aide, who was not identified, had been in isolation since beginning to show symptoms. The person had no known contact with the senator or any other members of Congress, according to the statement, and the senator asked for testing for any staff members who came into contact with the person and show symptoms of the virus. Ms. Cantwell has also closed her Washington office for deep cleaning. Staff members will be working remotely. There has been no indication that lawmakers, who are scheduled to vote on Thursday before leaving for a weeklong recess, will leave Washington earlier than planned. Democratic lawmakers are wrapping up an expansive legislative package to counter the outbreak and provide support for families affected by the virus.

Mike DeWine said a ban on large events was imminent. Churches and college campuses shut their doors. New York Citys St. Patricks Day Parade, the largest such celebration in the world, was postponed. And in Washington State, where the virus has hit Americans hardest, Gov. Jay Inslee said on Wednesday that people should no longer sit shoulder-to-shoulder in local bars. In the era of the coronavirus, he said, such socializing has become just totally unacceptable. Governments around the country were rapidly embarking on new containment efforts on Wednesday as the rose to more than 1,200, a day after jumping by more than one-third. People in 42 states and the District of Columbia have now tested positive for the virus, and there have been at least 37 related deaths. Nowhere have the moves become more drastic and more urgent than in the Seattle area, where the state banned public gatherings of 250 people or more in three counties. Within hours, several local school districts with a combined enrollment of about 100,000 students said they would close for at least two weeks; a Patti Smith concert was postponed; and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle canceled all public masses, becoming the first Catholic archdiocese in the country to do so. In San Francisco, where Mayor London N. Breed announced of more than 1,000 people, the San Francisco Giants announced that their exhibition game against the Oakland Athletics scheduled for March 24 would not take place at Oracle Park. Ohios governor said he would impose a similar ban after new evidence concluded that the virus was spreading through community transmission in the state. People are going to say, Oh my God, really, youre doing that? Governor DeWine . Youre going to look back on it in a week and say, That wasnt a difficult decision. In New York, the state and city universities and colleges, with about 700,000 students in all, will shift primarily to online classes starting on March 19, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday. Many other , and some have told students not to return after their spring breaks.

A top federal health official gave lawmakers a stark warning on Wednesday that the coronavirus would continue to spread in the United States, and said that fans should be barred from big gatherings like National Basketball Association games. The bottom line: It is going to get worse, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the House Oversight Committee. We would recommend that there not be large crowds, he added. If that means not having any people in the audience as the N.B.A. plays, so be it. Dr. Fauci sought to rebut the claim repeated often by President Trump that the coronavirus was no worse than the flu. People always say, Well, the flu does this, the flu does that. The flu has a mortality of 0.1 percent. This has a mortality of 10 times that, Dr. Fauci said. DR.

A supply shortage is looming that could keep laboratories around the United States from meeting the ballooning demand for coronavirus testing. For weeks, doctors and labs have complained that there werent nearly enough test kits to take samples from all the patients who showed signs of infection. That shortfall is easing after a botched rollout, but is not over. Laboratories warn that they are running low on supplies used to extract viral RNA from nasal swabs supplies that are not included in the kits. Some lab directors have also had trouble getting the virus samples needed to validate their tests. And many are worried about a possible shortage of reagents, the chemicals used in the tests. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this week that labs could test one swab per patient, rather than two, cutting the chemical demand in half. Qiagen, a major manufacturer of the RNA extraction kits, said in a statement this week that it was increasing production in sites in Germany, Spain and Maryland. The C.D.C. and the Food and Drug Administration have said they are aware of potential shortages and are monitoring supplies, but it is not clear what they might do to address the problems.

Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday said that the coronavirus was likely to infect about two-thirds of the German population. But her top medical adviser, Dr. Lothar Weiler, who appeared with her, added that, we dont know how fast that will happen. One of the countrys top virologists recently said that it could take a year or two, or even longer, for that many people to become infected. At a news conference, Ms. Merkel said: Given a virus for which there is no immunity and no immunization, we have to understand that many people will be infected. The consensus among experts is that 60 to 70 percent of the population will be infected. The heart of her message was that Germans should take precautions to ensure that the health system can handle the high number of people who could fall seriously ill. She urged people to stay at home as much as possible. How we respond matters, Ms. Merkel said. We are playing for time. We are at the start of a development that we cannot yet see the end of, she told reporters in her first public appearance to address the epidemic, which has already infected more than 1,600 people in Germany. But we as a country will do whatever is necessary to do, working within the European bloc. That readiness includes flexibility on spending, especially to help the small and midsize enterprises that are losing business, she said. We wont ask every day, What does this mean for our deficit? said Ms. Merkel.

The coronavirus has touched a diverse collection of countries and cultures, but a number of shared experiences have emerged from grieving the dead to writing songs.  There are moments that seem bizarre, moments of fear . preparation and moments of emptiness. These are scenes from the world living with coronavirus. It has spread across cultures, languages and even out to sea. And despite these global differences, a number of shared experiences have emerged. There is grief over the dead. In Iran, hospital staff mourn a doctors death from the virus. In China, a quarantined building collapses, and a firefighter breaks down after pulling bodies from the rubble. In Italy, a man mourns the death of his sister. To try and save lives, authorities take precautions. They disinfect public areas and screen populations. This is just crazy. Around the world, people are afraid and on edge. Unbelievable. In Northern Ireland, routine construction work at an Apple Store is mistaken for virus-related activity. In Japan, tempers flare when a man sneezes on a train. One Italian takes the fear and adds humor. This is a circle to keep people at a safe distance. In fact, lots of people use humor to cope with the uncertainty or the stigma of being sick. In Australia, a run on toilet paper leads to lessons in self-defense. Hes going to show you how to deal with people stealing your toilet paper. There is also defiance, a conviction that life must go on despite the virus. Across rooftops in China, quarantined neighbors socialize. From a rooftop in Italy, a theater group performs poetry for an area where movement is restricted. On a quarantined cruise ship, theres songwriting to pass the time. In an apartment in China, too. But perhaps some of the most striking moments from the pandemic are those where little happens: the empty streets. Unbelievable. No traffic. The quiet airports. The places of worship without worshippers. Stores without goods. This is how it is across the globe as we prepare, grieve and wait for the next chapter of the coronavirus. 00:00. 3:30. 3:30Fear, Humor, Defiance: How the World Is Reacting to Coronavirus.

Economic package will include paid sick leave and free virus testing, aides said. Congress on Thursday neared a deal with the White House on a sweeping economic rescue package to respond to the . After a day of intense negotiations between Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Ms. Pelosi told reporters that weve resolved most of our differences and that the House would vote on Friday on the measure, one way or another. It would then go to the Senate, which called off a recess that had been scheduled for next week. The legislation, Democratic aides said, will include enhanced unemployment benefits, free virus testing and aid for food assistance programs. The package also ensures 14 days of paid sick leave, as well as tax credits to help small- and medium-size businesses fulfill that mandate. Language was still being drafted for provisions related to family and medical leave, according to a Democratic aide, as aides worked through the night to prepare the bill. The fast-moving measure reflects a sense of urgency in Washington to enact a fiscal stimulus in the face of a pandemic that has wreaked havoc on the financial markets, which have proven impervious to other interventions. FREE ACCESS. The New York Times is providing on the global coronavirus crisis. The negotiations hit snags as Republicans balked at the sweeping proposal to provide paid sick leave, something Senate Republicans had already blocked when Democrats sought earlier in the week to bring up a separate bill. Mr. Mnuchin, in a frantic attempt to keep talks on track, spoke by phone at least seven times with Ms. Pelosi, negotiating additional changes to the House legislation so it could have a chance of winning the support of Mr. Trump and Senate Republicans. Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, warned that even a large stimulus package might not stop the fall in markets and that the worst may still lie ahead. What stops the fear is evidence that the rate of increase of infections is slowing believable evidence, he said.

Mr. Silver, who was being interviewed on TNTs Inside the N.B.A., said it was also possible that the rest of the season would be canceled. The N.B.A. announced on Wednesday that the season would be suspended after Rudy Gobert, a center for the Utah Jazz, tested positive for the coronavirus. Earlier in the week, Mr. Gobert had made light of concerns about the virus, which Mr. Silver referred to as a huge mistake. Mr. Gobert has since apologized on social media. Charles Barkley, one of the hosts of Inside the N.B.A., did not appear in the studio, joining instead by phone. He said he was self-quarantining for 48 hours after not feeling well after a flight from New York to Atlanta. He said he had been tested for the coronavirus but had not received the results.

Hosted by Michael Barbaro, produced by Clare Toeniskoetter and Michael Simon Johnson, and edited by Wendy Dorr. Our science reporter answers your questions about how protect yourself and your loved ones from the pandemic. Clare Toeniskoetter. Test test, test. OK. Just got to Donalds. Is it OK to lock my bike here?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Yeah, sure. You want to bring it inside?. Clare Toeniskoetter. If you dont think its exposed. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. OK. Hello. Clare Toeniskoetter. Hi. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. There. Clare Toeniskoetter. We just, rather than shaking hands, bumped elbows. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Yes, the W.H.O. elbow bump. You want to sit down?. Clare Toeniskoetter. Should I wash my hands?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Yeah. You probably should, as much for your protection as for mine. It depends on what you put your hands on. Clare Toeniskoetter. I wanted to ask you. We heard you, yesterday, sanitizing the studio. What do you do when you come home?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. I wash my hands. I know the inside of my house is clean, because the only people in here are my girlfriend and myself, and were both still healthy. But people who live upstairs and this is a two-apartment building we have agreed that we will tell each other if any of us has a fever or a cough, and we keep some alcohol wipes in the front hall to wipe down the doorknob, light switch, and other surfaces we might both touch, just to make sure that theres no possibility of us passing it back and forth to each other. I know it sounds kooky, but this is actually the way the disease gets transmitted. You dont have to be a crazy germaphobe. Or actually, at a time like this, it helps to be a crazy germaphobe just by instinct. And here. Ill wash my hands in front of you so that you know that my hands are clean. But the danger with somebody else is, of course, that theyre coughing. But Im not. Im fine. Clare Toeniskoetter. Ive never been in someones home in these circumstances. Michael Barbaro. From The New York Times, Im Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today, now that the coronavirus has gone from an epidemic to a pandemic, and both infections and deaths from the disease are surging across the world and the United States, we return to Times science reporter, Donald G. McNeil, Jr., who has covered the story from the start, to understand how to navigate this new reality. Its Friday, March 13. Michael Barbaro. Hey, Donald. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Hey. How are you?. Michael Barbaro. Good. Welcome back, and thank you for letting us into your home. I know weve been hearing a lot from you lately, so let us know if were beginning to exhaust your generosity. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. OK. So far, so good. Michael Barbaro. So far. Key word. Donald, when we first started talking to you about the coronavirus about two weeks ago, you gave us an overview of what it was, where it was headed. Since then, a lot has changed. Given the evolution of the situation, we have questions related to this new phase of the epidemic, now that its very much in our lives. Im working from home. Youre working from home. So lets start with questions about precautions for people who dont have the virus which, presumably, is the vast majority of us at the moment and how we can protect ourselves from getting the virus. What kind of activities should be avoided right now?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. You have to be aware not only of people around you who are coughing, but you also have to be aware that every basically every hard surface you touch might potentially have virus on it, unless you know its been cleaned since the last person that you dont know was there might have been on it. Michael Barbaro. Let me tick through a couple of what we imagine, from conversations with everybody on The Daily team at The Times, to be the kinds of scenarios I think people want to better understand how to approach. A bit of a lightning round here. Is it dangerous, at this moment, to keep going to work?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Look, some people are going to have to go to work. Doctors have to go to work. But its not so much the danger. The reason the governments asking people not to go to work is because it creates what they call social distancing. The less interactions there are between people, the less exchange of virus there is. If you slow down the virus, you change what is sometimes called R-naught. And if you get people to be more distant from each other, the virus is transmitted less. Michael Barbaro. Can you translate that phrase, R-naught?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Yeah. Its called the reproductive number of the virus. Its, If Im sick, how many people am I going to infect? You never know the real R-naught, or the real fatality rate, or anything about a disease, until its completely gone through the world. So were never going to know the real answers to these things for at least a year or two, because theyre going to be different in Africa than they are in New York. Theyre going to be different anywhere. But if you create more distance between people so that I infect, hopefully, no people, youve substantially slowed my part of transmitting the virus. And if you do that across the entire population, you really slow down the movement of that virus in the population. When a lot of people are infected, and a lot of people have pneumonia, a lot of people all need to get to the hospital at the same time. A lot of those people need to get on oxygen or on ventilators, and eventually you run out of ventilators. Then youre making the triage decisions that theyre now making in northern Italy, which is to say, OK, this is Donald McNeil, 66 years old. Ive got a choice between saving him or a 25-year-old mother of two. Goodbye, Mr. McNeil. Sorry there isnt any time for your family to say goodbye to you, because we cant have visitors, but thats it. See you later. Michael Barbaro. Sheesh. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Which is the right thing to do. Thats the right decision for a doctor to make. But those are really tough decisions for doctors. Michael Barbaro. Let me return to our lightning round that has not yet turned into a lightning round. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Sorry. Michael Barbaro. Based on some of what you just said, Im intuiting where this may be headed, but take the bus or the subway at this moment. Is that wise?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. I dont think its terribly wise. I did it yesterday to get home. I ride the subway standing up with my face close to the vent. I have one glove on my hand, one gardening glove, and I use that if I have to hold onto a rail. The other hand, I make sure, never touches a surface, and I use that for my phone. Mostly, I keep it in my pocket. And I wont get into a crowded car. Ill let the train go by. Michael Barbaro. But if you dont have to take the subway. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. If you dont have to take the subway, dont. Michael Barbaro. Staying on this theme lots of people are curious about plane travel. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. I would avoid plane travel if I could help it. I have friends who were about to fly to Kentucky to visit their son, and I said, you know what? Why dont you drive? You know where all the surfaces inside your car have been. You dont know where all the surfaces inside that plane or that airport have been. I know its going to be 11 hours instead of two hours, but Id say, do it. And thats what theyre doing. Michael Barbaro. How about trips to familiar retail establishments a grocery store, a restaurant?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Well, you have to have food, so go to the grocery store. Be super careful about the handle of the cart, and remember that every box you touch has been placed on that shelf by somebody who might have coughed into their hand. Now, restaurants I did eat in a restaurant a couple of nights ago. We looked for one that was, really, pretty empty, and we sat at the bar which had just been wiped down. But as this pandemic progresses, Ill worry more, and Ill probably avoid going into restaurants. Michael Barbaro. The gym. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Yeah, the gym. I go to a gym. I play squash, which means all I have to touch in common with the other player is the ball, and I know my partner. I would be real reluctant to start grabbing a bunch of weights, not knowing who else had touched them, grabbing a bunch of handles on machines, not knowing who had touched them. I would be reluctant to play basketball with a dozen other guys, because you cant have 10 guys handling the same ball. If one of them is spewing virus, a virus is going to get on the ball, and then everybodys got it on their hands. Michael Barbaro. How about movies, concerts things that might be open-air, but where people are sitting quite close to each other?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Open-air is safer than enclosed, but even in open-air venues, if youre sitting on a seat, the handles of the seat might have virus on them. The railings when you walk down to your seat might have virus on them. The ticket taker, as he takes your ticket and hands it back to you I know its paranoid-sounding, but these are all the ways that virus can be transmitted in large gatherings. Its not just the coughing. Its the many surfaces that get touched. Michael Barbaro. In general, Im hearing you say that going out and interacting with other people poses risks. So I wonder if you can help us understand the calculations behind your thinking in these particular categories. Does it have to do with the lifespan of the virus? Does it have to do with recommendations around social distancing? What is the underlying logic?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Yes. Theyre related to all these things. But I think people get way too obsessive about numbers, about exactly how many hours or days does the virus live on a surface? Exactly how many feet do you have to stand away from somebody else? I mean, you cant run around through life with a tape measure, trying to figure out, is 3 feet safe enough? Is 6 feet safe enough? But stay away from people who are coughing. Stay away from people who look feverish. And if you have to communicate with somebody, keep your distance. Thats what Id say. Just generally keep your distance. Michael Barbaro. Youve talked about social distancing. How do you socially distance yourself from your family, from your children, from your partner, your spouse, your boyfriend, your girlfriend? Does that really work?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. You cant. My girlfriend and I still kiss each other. We just trust each other enough to believe were not infected. Its impossible to socially distance yourself from your children. Theyre going to come up and hug you. Thats why the whole idea of home quarantine home isolation, rather is virtually impossible. Michael Barbaro. Donald, theres a strong sense that very young people and people in their teens, 20s, early 30s, are at a much lower risk level for the coronavirus. And I think thats been borne out. Correct me if Im wrong. So do all the recommendations that we keep hearing apply as stringently to the young?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Yes, unless youre totally selfish. Michael Barbaro. What you mean?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Do you have a parent? Do you have a grandparent? Do you want to be the vector that carries that disease to them? Do you know anybody and love anybody whos older and might be frail? You dont want your last memory of that person . being that you gave them the virus that killed them. Youll kick yourself for the rest of your life if you did that. People who were hospitalized in China started at age 30 and went up to 70s and 80s. Yes, on average, the outcomes are better. But if you want something to worry about, you might be the person who doesnt have a good outcome. Youre spreading a disease to your friends, your social circle. Thats something you ought to feel guilty about. Its not something you ought to feel indifferent about. People have to take this seriously. Michael Barbaro. Well be right back. Michael Barbaro. Weve been talking about precautions for people who dont have the virus and want to keep it that way. I want to turn, now, to what happens if you think you might have the virus. Based on your reporting, and based on the publicly available information, what are the first signs of illness that have been reported and that people, therefore, could be looking out for?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. What the Chinese found in the large study of the first 45,000 cases is that its not like a cold. Fever is the number-one sign. High fever, a dry cough, and then, after that, fatigue. Runny nose was only 4% of cases, and those people might have had flu or a cold at the same time. But theres something I wanted to say that was important. I described, in our first interview, that 80% of all cases were mild, and the other 20% were either severe or critical. And that stuck in too many peoples minds as if, oh, 80% of cases are practically nothing. You dont even have it. Maybe its asymptomatic. No. Thats wrong. The Chinese study that was based on everything was either mild, severe, or critical. Mild included everything from barely any symptoms to pneumonia, but pneumonia not needing hospitalization or oxygen. Once you stepped over into needing oxygen, then you were severe. Once you were in organ failure, you were critical. So if people think this is a mild disease, get over that idea. Im sorry if I contributed to the spread of that idea. I should have been much more careful in describing the whole range of symptoms that came under the term mild. Michael Barbaro. Right. In other words, mild doesnt necessarily mean mild. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Nothing like what we mean by a mild cold. Michael Barbaro. When is it recommended that, no matter how mild or severe the symptoms are, a person be tested? Is there a threshold?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. I dont know if the authorities have set a threshold yet. I know what happens in pandemics is that, ultimately, you have to assume that a lot of people have the disease. And that really when you reach the point where almost everybody has it, you end up stopping even bothering to test them. You ultimately are going to assume that everybody has it, because its the most popular virus going around. If you have no trouble breathing, if you have got a fever that you can handle at home, then stay home and take care of it. Although thats not the way the Chinese handled it. The Chinese said, if you think you have symptoms and I hope we get to this point. The Chinese said, if you think you have symptoms, if you think youre getting sick, get directed to a fever clinic, where somebody who is in protective gear can see you, and they will see you and sort out whether you have bacterial pneumonia, or flu, or whether you have coronavirus. And if you have coronavirus, youre going to go into isolation with a lot of other people who have coronavirus. Even if you have a very mild case, youre going to go in with all the other mild cases, because they know cases can crash. Its a pretty common phenomenon that people are going along OK with some breathing difficulty, and then in the second week, they crash. Their oxygen saturation drops, and they need oxygen. And in those cases, in the isolation centers in China, when you might be in a gymnasium with 1,000 other people, when you crashed, they recognized it right there. There was no wait, and they would move you to a hospital. Michael Barbaro. This is a bit of an ethics question, but lets say you get into a cab, and youre on your way to get tested for the coronavirus, or you hitch a ride with a friend. Should it be disclosed that you think you might have the virus? Should basically anyone you come in contact with be aware of your status?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Yes. Youre carrying a potentially lethal disease, so youve got to warn other people. Theres no ethical question about this. Unfortunately, this has been the story of I dont know how many pandemics. How many people have lied about having a sexually transmitted disease, especially in the five minutes right before they thought they were going to get lucky, and if they disclosed what they had, they were going to ruin the moment? Unfortunately, thats how a whole lot of sexually transmitted diseases, including H.I.V., get passed on. It takes a lot of courage to be that ethical, and I hope during this epidemic, people will. Michael Barbaro. And the test itself, it remains somewhat scarce, but to the degree you know it, can you describe the test? Is it a saliva swab?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. The point is to get a sample of where the virus is, so there are different ways of getting that swab. Typically, for a while, they were doing nasopharyngeal swabs, which is, basically, pushing a Q-tip so far up your nose that it feels like its going into your brain. But Ive seen swabs that were just taken from the back of the throat. And I know that there are some times, when people are coughing hard, they try to get them to cough up sputum so they can test that. You want to get a sample thats got virus from where the cells are infected. Originally, it attaches deep in the lungs, so youre trying to get a sample from there. But once it moves up into your nose and throat, maybe you can get a sample from there. So its very dangerous for the person whos trying to get the Q-tip in, or the sputum sample out, to be standing right in front of them as they do that. They have to be really protected in order to do that safely. Michael Barbaro. How long do the results generally seem to be taking for these tests?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. I was told that, in China, when they had the on-the-spot labs and the fever clinics, they could give you an answer in as little as four hours, but thats ideal. There were others of seven hours. Other times, they had to send it off someplace overnight. Until recently, weve been having to send every sample to Atlanta. So thats several days. Michael Barbaro. Right. To the C.D.C. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Yes, to the C.D.C. Michael Barbaro. Which is the least efficient version of this, it would seem. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Its the least efficient version, but for a while, it was the only accurate version, and a positive wasnt considered a positive until the C.D.C. had confirmed it. Weve got to solve this testing problem. Weve got to have it so that tests are literally right there, because youve got to diagnose people and then isolate them so they dont go home and give the virus to the family, and they dont go back to work and give the virus to their coworkers. Michael Barbaro. And we are not at that phase just yet, are we?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Right now, were not even talking about that phase. Thats how they did it in China. Right now, were still talking about home isolation, and the W.H.O., the Chinese, and the South Koreans would say, that doesnt work. Thats too dangerous. Theres no way you can isolate at home without infecting your family. Michael Barbaro. The final phase of questions, Donald, are, what happens when a person has been diagnosed with the virus? Youve told us that there really is no cure for the coronavirus. Its going to run its course. Are there useful over-the-counter medicines that would help somebody get through this virus?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. This is kind of crazy, because I dont think its safe to think of it as something you can happily stay home with and treat like, oh, Ive got the flu. Youve got to be aware that there is the possibility of crashing. Youve got to have a number you can call. The state should be aware that youre a patient, that youre in home quarantine, and there should be somebody checking in on you each day, or you should be checking in with somebody so that they say, how high is your fever? How fast are you breathing?. Michael Barbaro. How long can a person expect to be sick, once diagnosed?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Mild cases typically resolved themselves in two weeks. People who were on ventilators and in severe situations were usually three to six weeks. Michael Barbaro. Thats a long time. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Yeah. Thats a long time. Its a long time for one of your ventilators to be in use. Even the severe and the critical cases most of the time, they ended in good outcomes. But for some people, death took several weeks, too. People didnt just immediately crash and die. It would be a somewhat slow process. Michael Barbaro. Donald, once you have this virus, does it confer immunity on getting the coronavirus again in the next couple weeks, next couple of years, forever?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Nobody knows about forever. Virtually all doctors assume that having recovered from this confers immunity, because thats the norm. When you recover from a disease, you normally have immunity at least for a while. Michael Barbaro. Once a person recovers from the virus, is there permanent damage? Do we know?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Some people who have gone into severe pneumonia or A.R.D.S., adult respiratory distress syndrome, yes, will have permanent damage. Theyll live, but theyll have permanently damaged lungs. That can definitely happen. Michael Barbaro. And what do we know about how the virus, long-term, affects people who I think would be, justifiably, quite anxious at this moment pregnant women?.

Mcneil Jr. The ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
mall numbers of women that have been studied in China who were pregnant during this relatively short time period there was a study that came out just a couple of days ago. Nine women all delivered healthy babies. Something like six of the women were delivered by cesarean, which doctors may have chosen to do just for the extra safety of knowing that the baby wasnt going to be infected in the birth canal. But some of the babies were born naturally, too, and all the babies were healthy. Michael Barbaro. Thats reassuring. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Thats good news its a very small sample, but its good news from what we know from the small sample. Its really different from some other diseases. Michael Barbaro. Finally, Donald, we want to tackle a few questions that weve observed from friends, family and from the internet that may be in the territory of rumor or half-baked theories, but that are gaining some currency. So basically, a true-or-false section here. First off, are there multiple strains of the coronavirus, and are some more dangerous than others?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. No. There are slightly different variants of the coronavirus really, variances by a couple of nucleotides. There is no evidence that one is more infectious than the other, or one is more lethal than the other. Not so far, anyway. Michael Barbaro. Next. This is a seasonal virus, and it will more or less be gone in a few months. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. That would be lovely, but we dont know that. This is a new virus. Weve never seen it in summertime, so we dont know how its going to behave in summertime. Respiratory viruses like influenza tend to disappear in the summer. We dont know what this virus is going to do in the summer, so its not a good idea to make predictions. Thats just wishful thinking on the part of people who say, oh, its all going to disappear in the summertime. Michael Barbaro. And the last of these true-of-false questions, Donald. Are the media we hear this a lot blowing the scale of this out of proportion, given the relatively small number of infections compared with the overall populations in any given country?. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Look. I ask myself this question every day, because Im the media in this case. Normally, I get to blame the other jackals of the press for blowing things out of proportion, but this time . Michael Barbaro. Not this time. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. its on my shoulders. Id like to think theres nothing to worry about. I never worried about Ebola coming to New York. I never worried much about SARS spreading in New York. I worried, in the beginning, about H1N1 flu in 2009, but then, as the mortality data got clearer, I stopped worrying. I knew wed mostly get it, but I knew it would be, mostly, not a problem. This one, same as I said two-plus weeks ago, really flips me out. This one reminds me of 1918 a dangerous virus that transmits easily between people. Yes, 80% of the cases are mild, but as I described, mild is a term that the Chinese use describing all the way up to pneumonia. Thats not mild. We dont know what the fatality rate is. It got as high, in some weeks in Wuhan, as 5%. That was during the chaos period in Wuhan. We dont know what it is in Italy now, and we wont know, until its all over, what the total fatality rate is going to be. Id love to be told I was wrong, I was an alarmist, I should eat my hat. But well see. So far, Ive been right about every scary thing I said about this disease. Ive been worried, ever since I looked at the numbers, about how fast the epidemic was doubling in China, and how fast people were going to hospitals. I sat down and wrote down on a piece of paper about how fast this could double, and I came into work the next day and said, this is going to go pandemic. Originally, nobody believed me, and I had to call 12 different experts and count which ones believed me and which ones didnt believe me. It came out, basically, eight to two to two. Eight thought it . had the potential to go pandemic, two thought it was overblown, and two didnt want to comment, didnt want to take a guess. Michael Barbaro. It sounds like youre saying, so far, we havent blown it out of proportion, and you have been a relatively successful prognosticator of this virus. So thats why were going to keep talking to you about it. I want to tell you how much I appreciate you giving us your time and your wisdom. Thank you. Donald G. Mcneil Jr. Thank you for inviting me. Michael Barbaro. Over the coming weeks, well be answering your questions about the coronavirus and how to navigate the pandemic. You can send us your questions by voicemail at 646-598-6012. Be sure to tell us your name and where youre calling from. Well be right back. Heres what else you need to know today. Wall Street experienced its worst day since the crash of 1987 as investors responded to President Trumps plan to severely limit travel between Europe and the United States, and general confidence faded that Western economies will quickly recover from the pandemic. In Washington, the Senate canceled a scheduled week-long recess so it could negotiate a major economic relief package to address the financial fallout. Meanwhile, closures and cancellations cascaded across the country. The N.C.A.A. called off its annual basketball tournaments following a decision by the N.B.A. to suspend its operations. Both the N.H.L. and Major League Soccer said that they, too, would pause their seasons. In New York, all 41 Broadway theaters began shutting down on Thursday night under instructions from the states governor and will not reopen until April 12 at the earliest, while New York restaurants and bars have been ordered to operate at 50% capacity. And in California, Disneyland will close its doors until the end of the month, its first closure since the September 11 terror attacks in 2001.

Biden Jr. during a break in a Democratic debate in Charleston, S.C., last month.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times. Former Vice President s presidential campaign told staff members to work from home, closed all its offices to the public and said it would begin holding smaller events and virtual fund-raisers, according to an internal campaign memo released Thursday. Mr. Bidens main rival in the Democratic primary, Senator of Vermont, took similar precautions. Mr. Sanderss campaign said that it had asked all staff members to work from home and that it would no longer hold large events or door-to-door canvasses, focusing on digital outreach instead. Mr. Biden who has a famously tactile campaigning style acknowledged in a speech on Thursday the need for radical changes in our personal behaviors that could affect deeply ingrained behavior like handshakes and hugs. The candidates shift away from big events is likely to hurt Mr. Sanders, who is trying against lengthening odds to overtake Mr. Biden in the nomination fight. His huge rallies have served as a show of force. POLITICAL FALLOUT. How the the 2020 political campaign. Italian doctors confront unthinkable choices about life and death.

Every day, the medical workers of northern Italy face an awful question: Which patients, whom you would have treated a few weeks ago, do you turn away now, or even allow to die?. With more than 15,000 infections diagnosed across the country, and more than 1,000 deaths, Italy is the hardest-hit region in Europe. It has turned into a test of the limits of a modern health care system swamped by an epidemic and a terrifying glimpse of what other countries may soon face. This week outside of China restricting movement and closing most businesses to slow the spread of the virus. But local officials report instances of overwhelmed doctors and nurses simply leaving some elderly patients untreated; hospitals sending people with pneumonia home; and hospital staffs having to choose who to deny the use of scarce equipment like ventilators. Medical workers are collapsing from exhaustion, and taking ill themselves. This is a war, said Massimo Puoti, the head of infectious medicine at Niguarda Hospital in Milan, one of the largest in Lombardy, the province at the heart of the epidemic. New York to ban most gatherings of more than 500 people, including on Broadway.

New York will ban most gatherings of more than 500 people, including at Broadway shows, and restrict smaller groups, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced on Thursday. The restrictions, intended to slow a growing outbreak in the state, are expected to have a profound impact on the citys cultural institutions, including theater, a multibillion dollar industry at the heart of New Yorks tourist trade. The ban took effect at 5 p.m. Thursday for Broadway theaters and will do the same for other venues Friday at 5 p.m., Mr. Cuomo said. The Broadway League, a trade organization representing producers and theater owners, through April 12. Later in the afternoon, Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency and stressed that the city would be dealing with the effects of the coronavirus for the long haul. Going to this level is not done lightly but it has reached the point where it is necessary, he said. He cited the potential for major job losses, evictions, business closings and people running short of food.

Officials in Maryland, Ohio and Washington State announced on Thursday that schools in those states would close for several weeks. Ohios action was the most sweeping. Gov. Mike DeWine said that all primary and secondary schools would close for three weeks starting on Monday. Ohio has just five known cases of the virus so far, but the governor said the move was meant to get ahead of the spread and help save lives. This is the time to do it, he said . Maryland officials ordered all public schools in the state to close from Monday until March 27. And in Washington State, which has the most cases of any state in the nation, Governor Inslee said he had made the very difficult decision to close the schools in King, Snohomish and Pierce counties, the heart of the outbreak in the Seattle area, probably through late April. Widespread closures of K-12 schools are a significant shift in American life, upending child care plans and raising questions about meals and care for low-income and homeless students. In New York City, where two public schools were closed on Thursday after a child tested positive, Mayor Bill de Blasio has resisted citywide closings, citing the extreme hardship that would cause for poor students and their working parents. THE VIRUS AND CITY LIFE. U.S. in the face of coronavirus. Argentina will halt flights from the U.S. and Europe. President Alberto Fernandez of Argentina said on Thursday that the government would suspend flights from the United States and Europe for 30 days in an effort to slow down the spread of the new coronavirus in the South American nation. Mr. Fernandez also announced strict quarantine protocols for people who arrive in Argentina after having traveled to places with a significant number of cases, including China, South Korea, Iran, Japan, Europe and the United States. Argentina had 31 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Thursday, including one fatality. It was not immediately clear when the flights would stop. But the measure appeared certain to leave thousands of passengers stranded. Argentina receives more than 20 flights daily from cities in Europe and the United States.

Husband-and-wife pastors from Burkina Faso who traveled to France in February were found to have the coronavirus after they developed symptoms following Sunday services at their 12,000-capacity megachurch in their countrys capital, Ouagadougou. The possible mass exposure comes on a continent that has so far largely escaped the sweep of the virus across the globe. Egypt has the highest number of confirmed cases, with around 60, most of them aboard a Nile cruise ship. South Africa has 15, and there is a scattering of cases elsewhere in Africa, many involving Europeans. Africas many megachurches and their vast congregations have been a source of worry for the spread of coronavirus, particularly after a large majority of the more than 7,800 cases in South Korea were traced back to . The pastors, Mamoudou Karambiri and Hortense Karambiri, had spent the week of Feb. 17-24 praying and fasting with more than 2,000 fellow evangelicals at an annual Lenten gathering in France, which has one of Europes highest caseloads. They then returned to their home church, Bethel Israel Tabernacle, and held a Sunday service on March 1. According to who attended the Lenten prayer week, held in Mulhouse, France, carried the virus to other parts of France and to Guyana. A top U.S. health official says coronavirus testing is a failing. 0:00/2:05. Thats Really Disturbing: Health Officials Grilled on Coronavirus Testing. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz pressed top health officials about the current shortcomings of the governments coronavirus response. There are countless more examples of problems with people getting access to tests all across the country, including in my home state of Florida. We need to have someone in charge of making sure that as many people as possible across this country have access to getting tested as soon as possible. Who is that person? Is it you? Is it the vice president? Can you give us the name of who can guarantee that anyone, but especially health care workers, who need to be tested can be? As I tried to explain to Congressman Green, from the C.D.C. perspective OK, Im asking for a name. Who is in charge of making sure that people who need to get tested, who are indicated to be tested, can get a test? Who? Yeah, I was trying to say that the responsibility that I have at C.D.C. is make sure all the public health labs have it, and they can make the judgment on how they want to use it. But theyre referencing people who have been advised to be tested to you, and theyve been turned down. So is it you? As I said, Im going to look into the specifics I know that. So basically youre saying, reclaiming my time, basically you seem to be saying, because you cant name anyone specifically, that theres no one specifically in charge that we can count on to make sure that people who need to be tested health care workers or anyone else theres not one person that can ensure that these tests can be administered. Yes or no? My colleague is looking at me to answer. The system, the system does not, is not really geared to what we need right now, what you are asking for. That is a failing. A failing, yes. It is a failing. Lets admit it. The fact is, the way the system was set up is that the public health component that Dr. Redfield was talking about was a system where you put it out there in the public and a physician asks for it and you get it. The idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it were not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes, but were not.

One of the countrys top health officials said that the governments coronavirus testing methods were inadequate in testimony on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Speaking at a House committee hearing on coronavirus testing, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fielded pointed questions about rising frustration over a lack of testing kits across the country. The system does not, is not really geared to what we need right now, what you are asking for, Dr. Fauci said. That is a failing. It is a failing, lets admit it. Dr. Fauci had stepped in to respond to a question, from Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, to Dr. Redfield about who was ultimately responsible for overseeing testing. The idea of anybody getting it, easily, the way people in other countries are doing it, we are not set up for that, Dr. Fauci added. Do I think we should be? Yes. But we are not.

On both sides of the Atlantic on Thursday, the consequences of began to be felt economically, politically and socially. Traveling Americans sought to understand what Mr. Trumps plan meant for them, and European Union leaders sharply condemned the move, even as many nations on the Continent moved to tighten their own restrictions on the movement of people. The coronavirus is a global crisis, not limited to any continent and it requires cooperation rather than unilateral action, a statement from European leaders said. The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation.

The C.D.C. scenarios have not been publicly disclosed. Without an understanding of how experts view the threat, it remains unclear how far Americans will go in adopting socially disruptive steps that could help avert deaths.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times. By . Published March 13, 2020Updated March 18, 2020. 1583. Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and epidemic experts from universities around the world conferred last month about what might happen if the new gained a foothold in the United States. How many people might die? How many would be infected and need hospitalization?. One of the agencys top disease modelers, Matthew Biggerstaff, presented the group on the phone call with four possible scenarios A, B, C and D based on characteristics of the virus, including estimates of how transmissible it is and the severity of the illness it can cause. The assumptions, reviewed by The New York Times, were shared with about 50 expert teams to model how the virus could tear through the population and what might stop it. The C.D.C.s scenarios were depicted in terms of percentages of the population. Translated into absolute numbers by independent experts using simple models of how viruses spread, the worst-case figures would be staggering if no actions were taken to slow transmission. Between 160 million and 214 million people in the United States could be infected over the course of the epidemic, according to a projection that encompasses the range of the four scenarios. That could last months or even over a year, with infections concentrated in shorter periods, staggered across time in different communities, experts said. As many as 200,000 to 1.7 million people could die. And, the calculations based on the C.D.C.s scenarios suggested, 2.4 million to 21 million people in the United States could require hospitalization, potentially crushing the nations medical system, which has . Fewer than a tenth of those are for people who are critically ill. The assumptions fueling those scenarios are mitigated by the fact that cities, states, businesses and individuals are beginning to take steps to slow transmission, even if some are acting less aggressively than others. The C.D.C.-led effort is developing more sophisticated models showing how interventions might decrease the worst-case numbers, though their projections have not been made public.

When people change their behavior,"" said Lauren Gardner, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering who models epidemics, those model parameters are no longer applicable, so short-term forecasts are likely to be more accurate. There is a lot of room for improvement if we act appropriately. Those actions include testing for the virus, tracing contacts, and reducing human interactions by stopping mass gatherings, working from home and curbing travel. In just the last two days, multiple schools and colleges closed, sports events were halted or delayed, Broadway theaters went dark, companies barred employees from going to the office and more people said they were following hygiene recommendations. The Times obtained screenshots of the C.D.C. presentation, which has not been released publicly, from someone not involved in the meetings. The Times then verified the data with several scientists who did participate. The scenarios were marked valid until Feb. 28, but remain roughly the same, according to Ira Longini, co-director of the Center for Statistics and Quantitative Infectious Diseases at the University of Florida. He has joined in meetings of the group. 0:00/3:30. Fear, Humor, Defiance: How the World Is Reacting to Coronavirus. The coronavirus has touched a diverse collection of countries and cultures, but a number of shared experiences have emerged from grieving the dead to writing songs.  There are moments that seem bizarre, moments of fear . preparation and moments of emptiness. These are scenes from the world living with coronavirus. It has spread across cultures, languages and even out to sea. And despite these global differences, a number of shared experiences have emerged. There is grief over the dead. In Iran, hospital staff mourn a doctors death from the virus. In China, a quarantined building collapses, and a firefighter breaks down after pulling bodies from the rubble. In Italy, a man mourns the death of his sister. To try and save lives, authorities take precautions. They disinfect public areas and screen populations. This is just crazy. Around the world, people are afraid and on edge. Unbelievable. In Northern Ireland, routine construction work at an Apple Store is mistaken for virus-related activity. In Japan, tempers flare when a man sneezes on a train. One Italian takes the fear and adds humor. This is a circle to keep people at a safe distance. In fact, lots of people use humor to cope with the uncertainty or the stigma of being sick. In Australia, a run on toilet paper leads to lessons in self-defense. Hes going to show you how to deal with people stealing your toilet paper. There is also defiance, a conviction that life must go on despite the virus. Across rooftops in China, quarantined neighbors socialize. From a rooftop in Italy, a theater group performs poetry for an area where movement is restricted. On a quarantined cruise ship, theres songwriting to pass the time. In an apartment in China, too. But perhaps some of the most striking moments from the pandemic are those where little happens: the empty streets. Unbelievable. No traffic. The quiet airports. The places of worship without worshippers. Stores without goods. This is how it is across the globe as we prepare, grieve and wait for the next chapter of the coronavirus. 00:00. 3:30. 3:30Fear, Humor, Defiance: How the World Is Reacting to Coronavirus.

Devin OMalley, a spokesman for the task force, said that senior health officials had not presented the findings to the group, led by Vice President Mike Pence, and that nobody in Mr. Pences office has seen or been briefed on these models. Updated 47m ago. More live coverage: . The assumptions in the C.D.C.s four scenarios, and the new numerical projections, fall in the range of others developed by independent experts. Dr. Longini said the scenarios he helped the C.D.C. refine had not been publicly disclosed because there remained uncertainty about certain key aspects, including how much transmission could occur from people who showed no symptoms or had only mild ones. Were being very, very careful to make sure we have scientifically valid modeling thats drawing properly on the epidemic and whats known about the virus, he said, warning that simple calculations could be misleading or even dangerous. You cant win. If you overdo it, you panic everybody. If you underdo it, they get complacent. You have to be careful. But without an understanding of how the nations top experts believe the virus could ravage the country, and what measures could slow it, it remains unclear how far Americans will go in adopting or accepting socially disruptive steps that could also avert deaths. And how quickly they will act. Studies of previous epidemics have shown that the longer officials waited to encourage people to distance and protect themselves, the less useful those measures were in saving lives and preventing infections.

A fire on your stove you could put out with a fire extinguisher, but if your kitchen is ablaze, that fire extinguisher probably wont work, said Dr. Carter Mecher, a senior medical adviser for public health at the Department of Veterans Affairs and a former director of medical preparedness policy at the White House during the Obama and Bush administrations. Communities that pull the fire extinguisher early are much more effective. From Flu to Coronavirus. Dr. Biggerstaff presented his scenarios in a meeting held weekly to model the pandemics effects in the United States, Dr. Longini said. Its participants had been at work for several months before the emergence of the virus, modeling a potential influenza pandemic. We just kind of retooled, re-shifted, said Dr. Longini. The prioritys now coronavirus. Sign up to receive our daily Coronavirus Briefing, an informed guide with the latest developments and expert advice. Sign Up. The four scenarios have different parameters, which is why the projections range so widely. They variously assume that each person with the coronavirus would infect either two or three people; that the hospitalization rate would be either 3 percent or 12; and that either 1 percent or a quarter of a percent of people experiencing symptoms would die. Those assumptions are based on what is known so far about how the virus has behaved in other contexts, including in China. Other weekly C.D.C. modeling meetings center on how the virus is spreading internationally, the impact of community actions such as closing schools, and estimating the supply of respirators, oxygen and other resources that could be needed by the nations health system, participants said. In the absence of public projections from the C.D.C., outside experts have stepped in to fill the void, especially in health care. Hospital leaders have called for more guidance from the federal government as to what might lie in store in the coming weeks. Even severe flu seasons stress the nations hospitals to the point of setting up tents in parking lots and keeping people for days in emergency rooms. Coronavirus is likely to cause five to 10 times that burden of disease, said Dr. James Lawler, an infectious diseases specialist and public health expert at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Hospitals need to start working now, he said, to get prepared to take care of a heck of a lot of people. Dr. Lawler recently presented his own best guess projections to American hospital and health system executives at a private webinar convened by the American Hospital Association. He estimated that some 96 million people in the United States would be infected. Five out of every hundred would need hospitalization, which would mean close to five million hospital admissions, nearly two million of those patients requiring intensive care and about half of those needing the support of ventilators. Dr. Lawlers calculations suggested 480,000 deaths, which he said was conservative. By contrast, about , according to the C.D.C. Unlike with seasonal influenza, the entire population is thought to be susceptible to the new coronavirus. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, speaking at a congressional hearing on Thursday, said predictions based on models should be treated with caution. All models are as good as the assumptions that you put into the model, he said, responding to a question from Representative Rashida Tlaib about an that the United States could have 70 million to 150 million coronavirus cases. What will determine the ultimate number, he said, will be how you respond to it with containment and mitigation. Clues From 1918. Independent experts said these projections were critically important to act on, and act on quickly. If new infections can be spread out over time rather than peaking all at once, there will be less burden on hospitals and a lower ultimate death count. Slowing the spread will paradoxically make the outbreak last longer, but will cause it to be much milder, the modelers said. A Red Cross hospital in Wuhan, China, the outbreaks epicenter. Credit...Agence France-Presse Getty Images. A preliminary study released on Wednesday by the Institute for Disease Modeling projected that in the Seattle area, enhancing social distancing limiting contact with groups of people by 75 percent could reduce deaths caused by infections acquired in the next month from 400 to 30 in the region. A recent paper, cited by Dr. Fauci at a news briefing on Tuesday, concludes that the rapid and aggressive quarantine and social distancing measures applied by China in cities outside of the outbreaks epicenter achieved success. Most countries only attempt social distancing and hygiene interventions when widespread transmission is apparent. This gives the virus many weeks to spread, the paper said, with the average number of people each new patient infects higher than if the measures were in place much earlier, even before the virus is detected in the community. By the time you have a death in the community, you have a lot of cases already, said Dr. Mecher. Its giving you insight into where the epidemic was, not where it is, when you have something fast moving. He added: Think starlight. That light isnt from now, its from however long it took to get here. He said a single targeted step a school closing, or a limit on mass gatherings cannot stop an outbreak on its own. But as with Swiss cheese, layering them together can be effective. This conclusion is backed up by history. The most lethal pandemic to hit the United States was the 1918 Spanish flu, which was responsible for about 675,000 American deaths, according to . The Institute for Disease Modeling equally transmissible as the 1918 flu, and just slightly less clinically severe, and it is higher in both transmissibility and severity compared with all other flu viruses in the past century. Dr. Mecher and other researchers studied deaths during that pandemic a century ago, comparing the experiences of various cities, including what were then Americas third- and fourth-largest, Philadelphia and St Louis. In October of that year Dr. Rupert Blue, Americas surgeon general, urged local authorities to close all public gathering places if their community is threatened with the epidemic, such as schools, churches, and theaters. There is no way to put a nationwide closing order into effect, he wrote, as this is a matter which is up to the individual communities. The mayor of St. Louis quickly took that advice, closing for several weeks theaters, moving picture shows, schools, pool and billiard halls, Sunday schools, cabarets, lodges, societies, public funerals, open air meetings, dance halls and conventions until further notice. The death rate rose, but stayed relatively flat over that autumn. Credit...PNAS. By contrast, Philadelphia took none of those measures; the epidemic there had started before Dr. Blues warning. Its death rate skyrocketed. The speed and deadliness of the pandemic humbled doctors then much as the coronavirus pandemic is doing now. Some commented on the difficulty of getting healthy people to take personal precautions to help protect others at greater risk. Modern societies have tools that did not exist then: advanced hospitals, the possibility of producing a vaccine in roughly a year, the production of diagnostics. But other signs are more worrying. The world population is about triple the size it was the year before the 1918 flu, with 10 times as many people over 65 and 30 times as many over 85. These groups have proven especially likely to become critically ill and die in the current coronavirus pandemic. In Italy, that ventilators are being rationed. Its so important that we protect them, said Dr. Gabriel Leung, a professor in population health at Hong Kong University. In work accepted for publication in the journal Nature Medicine, he estimated that 1.5 percent of symptomatic people with the virus died. He and others who have devoted their careers to modeling said that looking at the experiences of other countries already battling the coronavirus was all it took to know what needed to be done in the United States. All U.S. cities and states have the natural experiment of the cities that have preceded us, namely the superb response of Singapore and Hong Kong, said Dr. Michael Callahan, an infectious disease specialist at Harvard. Those countries implemented school closures, eliminated mass gatherings, required work from home, and rigorously decontaminated their public transportation and infrastructure. They also conducted widespread testing. They were able to reduce an explosive epidemic to a steady state one, Dr. Callahan said. As in the case of an approaching hurricane, Dr. Mecher said, Youve got to take potentially very disruptive actions when the sun is shining and the breeze is mild.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

John Mixon, 86, a retired law professor, said he waited nearly two hours at Kennedy International Airport after arriving from Amman, Jordan, missing his connecting flight to Houston because of the slow screening process. Mr. Mixon said he and his wife were shuffled into a packed room with more than 100 others for hours before a few C.D.C. officials came in and asked everyone if they had been to China or Italy. Only one man raised his hand, and everyone else was told they could leave after getting their temperatures taken, Mr. Mixon said. Since January, officers from Customs and Border Protection have been on heightened alert for travelers who might spread the virus.

President Trump tested negative for the coronavirus, his doctor said in a memo released Saturday evening. The presidents health had been a concern since he spent time at his Florida resort last weekend with a Brazilian official who was later found to have the illness. One week after having dinner with the Brazilian delegation at Mar-a-Lago, the president remains symptom-free, said Dr. Sean P. Conley, Mr. Trumps doctor, in that memo. At a news conference earlier Saturday, Mr. Trump announced that he had been tested for the coronavirus on Friday night and was awaiting the results. Vice President Mike Pence also announced the extension of the administrations European travel ban to the United Kingdom and Ireland. Whether the president would be tested had been a matter of speculation since it first emerged that a member of a Brazilian delegation that visited Mar-a-Lago had tested positive. Two other people who were with the president at Mar-a-Lago have tested positive, and various members of Congress have been self-isolating after interacting with some of those same people. Mr. Trump, wearing a USA baseball cap, said he decided to be tested for the coronavirus after his news conference on Friday, during which he declared a national emergency. People were asking, did I take the test, he said. Asked when he expected to have the result, Mr. Trump said, A day, two days. They send it to a lab, he said. A PRESIDENTIAL TEST. Medical experts to the coronavirus. It was unclear if Mr. Pence, who interacted with some of the infected Mar-a-Lago visitors, had known that the president was tested. Asked about his own status, Mr. Pence said, Im going to speak immediately after this news conference with the White House physicians office, which he said had previously advised him that neither he nor his wife needed to be tested.

Spain and France announced drastic, countrywide restrictions on Saturday to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Spain ordered all citizens to confine themselves to their homes and to leave only to buy food, go to work, seek medical care or assist the elderly and others in need. Officials in Spain reported 1,500 new cases, the largest daily increase in the country so far, pushing its total to 5,753. The government ordered all schools, restaurants and bars to close, extending measures that various regional authorities, including in Madrid and in Catalonia, had taken on Friday. Also on Saturday, Spanish authorities said the wife of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, Begona Gomez, had tested positive for the virus. France announced the , including restaurants, bars, and movie theaters, after a sharp uptick in the assault from the coronavirus. French cases doubled over the last 72 hours to about 4,500. There have been 91 deaths, and 300 coronavirus patients are in critical condition half of them under 60 years of age. The measures in both countries follow similar moves in Italy, the hardest hit country in Europe. Italy has been locked down since early in the week, with only groceries, pharmacies and banks allowed to operate.

By evening, 49 states, plus Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., had confirmed cases of the illness. Only West Virginia was without a diagnosis. A MONSTER THATS LOOMING. West Virginia is the last state without a coronavirus case. Nationwide, businesses, schools and public officials continued to struggle with an outbreak that has left more than 50 people dead and upended nearly all aspects of public life. More than 400 new cases have been reported in each of the last three days. Many churches canceled plans for Sunday worship or urged their members to watch online instead of coming in person. In the Omaha area, officials reported the first known instance of community spread. In Illinois, a nursing facility where a woman tested positive for the virus was placed on lockdown. And in Pittsburgh, where the first local cases were announced on Saturday, city leaders urged bars to promote social distancing by limiting the number of people they allowed inside. Elsewhere, officials were making provisions to house and isolate large numbers of people with the virus. The closing of schools in continues to create concerns that children may miss meals and parents may not be able to stay home from work. After Los Angeles Unified School District announced it was closing, school officials said that they would open 40 to provide child care and meals to students whose parents cannot get out of work.

Costa Cruises, an Italian subsidiary of Miami-based Carnival Corp., says the ship, the Costa Luminosa is now heading to Marseille, France. The Costa Luminosa set sail on March 5 from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for a trans-Atlantic voyage. The ship called for an ambulance when it docked in San Juan on Sunday, March 8. Puerto Rican doctors suspected that the woman, 68, had the coronavirus and hospitalized her. Her husband, 70, was asymptomatic. By the time Puerto Rico announced the hospitalization, hundreds of passengers had spent the day mingling in colonial Old San Juan, and the ship had left port. It took five more days to confirm the cases. The island had no tests, so samples were taken from the couple and sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Gov.

No one I know of has been tested in our ship, Ms. Bitner said in a WhatsApp message. Costa Cruises said that the ship was not in quarantine, but that the sanitary protocol on board had been increased and close contacts of the passengers who tested positive had been isolated in their cabins. Costa Cruises also said that it was instituting a daily temperature check for crew and passengers.

The Afghan government closed all schools and universities for a month and asked people to avoid weddings and engagements events that usually draw thousands. The war-torn country, which shares a porous border with Iran, reported its 11th case on Saturday. But testing is severely limited, so its hard to gauge how widespread the outbreak is. Indonesia reported a sharp increase that raised its number of cases to 96, with 5 deaths. The governor of Jakarta announced that schools in the capital would close for two weeks. The transportation minister, Budi Karya Sumadi, has tested positive. Singapore has closed all its 70 mosques for five days to disinfect them, after the spread of the virus in at least three countries Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore was connected to a gathering of 16,000 people at a mosque near the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur.

After Trump oversells a Google site for coronavirus testing, White House officials downplay expectations. Researchers at Verily, a life sciences subsidiary of Googles parent company, in San Francisco, in 2018.Credit...Jim Wilson/The New York Times. On Friday, President Trump announced at that Verily, a life sciences subsidiary of Googles parent company, was helping to develop a website that would sharply expand testing for the virus, falsely claiming that Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now and adding that theyve made tremendous progress. In the hours after the presidents remarks, Google officials distanced themselves from the project, directing question to Verily, where a spokeswoman said the company was merely in the early stages of development. The project at Verily which has a total of about 1,000 employees has a pilot program planned for the San Francisco area, but has yet to unveil a website and identify testing locations. The coronavirus tests themselves are not yet widely available. The presidents effort to sell the website as a significant response to an urgent public health crisis came amid a national outcry over the administrations repeated failures to deliver on promises to quickly expand access to testing for the virus. The disconnect between Mr. Trumps exuberant comments and the projects more modest expectations was the latest example of the president exaggerating, overselling or making wholly inaccurate statements about , even as facts on the ground contradicted his rosy assessments of progress. Since then, Google executives have scrambled to coordinate with the White House in an effort to do as much as possible to make the presidents vision for the website a reality. On Saturday, Google placed a link on its home page a rare use of its digital canvass to encourage people to take steps to prevent spreading the virus. In addition, Google said it was working on a separate national informational website to provide information on virus symptoms and testing sites. Administration officials on Saturday sought to play down expectations, saying that Verilys website could provide significant help in the fight against the virus if it operated only in the nine biggest hot spots around the country.

At precisely noon on Saturday, millions of Italians, from Piedmont to Sicily, leaned out of windows or stood on their balconies to applaud the health care workers in hospitals and other front-line medical staff who have been working round the clock to care for coronavirus patients. As church bells normally drowned out by traffic pealed in the surreal silence that defines Italy since Wednesdays lockdown, applause filled streets, piazzas and even country roads, after messages went viral on social media calling Italians to put their hands together. There was a similar response to another online appeal Friday evening, asking Italians to sing the national anthem or play it on a musical instrument at exactly 6 p.m. The socially distant flash mob swept social media. Naturally, not everyone is blessed with a voice like Pavarotti. Some Italians preferred banging on pots and calling out, We will make it. Its unclear who began the musical interlude, but in the land that gave the world opera, its clearly not meant to be a cacophonous mess, and a program for more songs is spreading online.

Amid a surge of false information on the new coronavirus, Apple said on Saturday that it will only allow virus-related apps from recognized health authorities like government agencies, health nonprofits and medical institutions in its app store. The company also said that it would prohibit virus-themed entertainment or game apps. Other big tech companies like have said they were working with authorities like the World Health Organization to combat conspiracy theories and misleading medical advice about the virus and to point people to credible sources of information on it. Apples announcement came one day after it , becoming one of the first major retailers to take such drastic measures. The companys chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said that Apple would shutter all stores until March 27, excluding those in mainland China where infections have significantly declined recently and in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The most effective way to minimize risk of the viruss transmission is to reduce density and maximize social distance, Mr. Cook said in a statement posted to the companys website. Many firms around the world are contemplating similar measures. Patagonia, the outdoor-clothing retailer, said on Friday that it would shut its stores until late March. Urban Outfitters, the apparel company, announced on Saturday evening that it was also closing its chains until further notice. Taco Bell followed soon after with a statement, saying it was preparing to limit service to drive-through and delivery only where necessary. Starbucks has said it would consider closing stores temporarily as a last resort.

Alvarado Jr. for The New York Times. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Sunday that no gatherings with 50 people or more including weddings, festivals, parades, concerts, sporting events or conferences be held in the United States for the next eight weeks in one of the federal governments most sweeping efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The C.D.C. said that its recommendation, which would drastically change life in the United States for the next two months, does not apply to the day to day operation of organizations such as schools, institutes of higher learning, or businesses and added that it was not intended to supersede the advice of local health officials. This recommendation is made in an attempt to reduce introduction of the virus into new communities, it said, and to slow the spread of infection in communities already affected by the virus. And the C.D.C. urged people to take care with even small gatherings. Events of any size should only be continued if they can be carried out with adherence to guidelines for protecting vulnerable populations, hand hygiene and social distancing, its recommendation said.

It felt like I had a bowling ball on my chest. Nobodys willing to see me, and nobody has the test kit and even C.D.C. is refusing to test me. I traced back, you know, my wife, she works at Amazon.

It was clearly obvious that they just are under capacity, and theyre not able to test. I eventually just gave up because, at that point, the testing criteria was so strict.

I cannot get myself, like I cannot convince my conscience to leave the house just thinking about that, Hey you went grocery shopping and now like five people died. So I just self quarantined myself and basically started working from home. We stocked up on food items as much as possible. I bought a 25 pound bag of rice. We bought beans. We got ready basically just to hunker down for those two weeks. At this point, Im telling people like make if you have a decision to make, think about survival and make the decision based on survival for yourself, your family and your community. We knew this was coming. The federal government is just completely bungling this, and our lives are at stake. I feel like theyre just leaving us here to die in Seattle. The most overwhelming feeling was you are on your own. Im just really concerned for those that this is going to affect the hardest. And I think we pretty much failed at early testing, early containment.

For the first time since World War II, the Kentucky Derby will not take place on the first Saturday in May. The Derby, the first jewel of horse racings Triple Crown, became the latest marquee sporting event forced to postpone because of the deepening coronavirus pandemic. Churchill Downs will hold a conference call on Tuesday morning to announce a makeup date for the race, which is expected to be Sept. 5.

Latin America begins grappling with the virus. A soldier tried to organize people waiting to enter a market in Lima on Monday.Credit...Rodrigo Abd/Associated Press. Stringent measures were imposed over the weekend in several Latin American nations, where the outbreak has generally arrived later than in Europe or North America. In Venezuela, President Nicolas Maduro an authoritarian leader whose government is considered illegitimate by the United States and about 60 other nations seized on the upheaval caused by the pandemic to present himself as a responsible guardian of public health. On Monday night, in an announcement made on state TV, Mr. Maduro said a nationwide quarantine would take effect Tuesday at 5 a.m. local time. The country is now at 33 cases, according to Mr. Maduro, who called the move a drastic and necessary measure. Earlier in the day, he responded to 17 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country by ordering a lockdown of the capital, Caracas, and six other states on Monday. We either go into quarantine, or the pandemic could brutally and tragically bring down our country, he said in a terse televised speech on Sunday that was a departure from his typically rambling addresses. He called on the United States to loosen sanctions against his government. Other Latin American countries have also responded to dozens of confirmed cases. Ecuador and Peru announced countrywide lockdowns. President Ivan Duque of Colombia shut the borders to nonresidents. In Costa Rica, the government decreed a state of emergency that included closing its borders. In contrast, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil encouraged mass demonstrations by his supporters against his opponents in Congress on Sunday. Though Mr. Bolsonaro has been close to people who tested positive for the virus, he shook hands and posed for photos with supporters. Scientists say there are likely 5 to 10 undetected cases for every confirmed one. Revelers on Bourbon Street in New Orleans on Saturday evening.Credit...William Widmer for The New York Times. Scientists tracking the spread of reported Monday that, for every confirmed case, there are most likely another five to 10 people in the community with undetected infections. On average these people are about half as infectious as confirmed ones, but they are responsible for transmitting the virus in nearly 80 percent of new cases, according to the report, which was based on data from China.

The researchers modeled the viruss natural spread in China before the government instituted a travel ban and an aggressive testing policy. During that time, from December 2019 through late January, about 85 percent of cases went undetected. That situation is analogous to the current state of affairs in the United States and other Western countries, where tests are not widely available, the researchers said. If we have 3,500 confirmed cases in the U.S., you might be looking at 35,000 in reality, said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University and the senior author of the new report, which was posted by the journal Science. The report is among the first to address two pressing questions: How many people are walking around with unrecognized infections, and how infectious are they? American policymakers have begun taking more aggressive measures to slow transmission, like , but access to tests has been difficult or nonexistent in much of the country.

The top official of the European Union said on Monday that she was proposing a shutdown of all nonessential travel into the bloc. President Emmanuel Macron of France said national leaders would approve the plan on Tuesday. We propose to introduce a temporary restriction to non-essential travel to the European Union, said Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, after a teleconference with G7 leaders. Of course there will be exemptions for E.U. citizens coming back home, health care workers, doctors and nurses. The restriction would last for 30 days, and would not interfere with travel from one European Union country to another. But some of the member states have already taken steps in that direction.

The Trump administration turns on itself. President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence before a news conference in the Rose Garden on Friday.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times. Infighting, turf wars and a president more concerned with the stock market and media coverage than policy have defined the Trump White House. They have also defined how it has . The White House culture that President Trump has fostered and abided by for more than three years has shaped his administrations response to a deadly pandemic that is upending his presidency and the rest of the country, with dramatic changes to how Americans live their daily lives. It all explains how Mr. Trump could announce he was dismissing his acting chief of staff as the crisis grew more severe, creating even less clarity in an already fractured chain of command. And it was a major factor in the presidents reluctance to even acknowledge a looming crisis, for fear of rattling the financial markets that serve as his political weather vane. Mr. Trump has refused repeated warnings to rely on experts, or to neutralize some of the power held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in favor of a traditional staff structure. He has rarely fully empowered people in the jobs they hold. Part of this is President Trump being Donald J. Trump, the same guy hes always been, and part of it is a government he has now molded in his image, rather than having a government as it has traditionally been, to serve the chief executive, and to serve the job of governing the country, said David Lapan, a former spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon, and a former aide of Mr. Kelly.

Six counties in Northern California have ordered all residents to shelter in place in an effort to stop the coronavirus from surging. The order, which takes effect Tuesday, is expected to disrupt life for millions of residents in Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties. The city of Berkeley also issued the same order. That means staying at home except for the most essential reasons. Officials said people would be allowed to leave the house for essential work, to go to a grocery store, pick up medication, or even walk the dog. But they urged everyone to practice social distancing while outside. It is now time to do your part, Dr. Scott Morrow, the San Mateo health officer, said in a statement. Its asking people to go home with their families and to stay there until they are told otherwise, said Mayor Joe Goethals of San Mateo, adding that only essential businesses like hospitals, grocery stores and pharmacies would remain open. I dont expect anyone to get arrested, said Mr. Goethals, who said people will still be allowed to go outside for limited activities, like buying food and getting fresh air. But its not optional.

Declaring we are at war, President Emmanuel Macron of France prohibited public gatherings of any size, postponed municipal elections and told people to stay in their homes except for essential needs. His order, which goes into effect on Tuesday, is one of the most stringent anywhere in Europe. Officials said that going out for a walk to get some fresh air would be allowed, but meeting a friend on a street or in a park would be punishable with a fine. Christophe Castaner, the interior minister, said anyone on a public outing would need to carry a document justifying it, even if only a sworn statement written by that person. He said that 100,000 law enforcement officers would be deployed to enforce the order. Olivier Veran, Frances health minister, said that the government was asking each French person to limit human contact to a maximum of five people a day. France, with more than 6,600 coronavirus cases and 148 deaths by Monday, had already ordered . We will be able to end the confinement, Mr. Veran said in a on Twitter. But without confinement, we will not be able to end the epidemic. Spain, with almost 10,000 cases and more than 300 deaths by Monday, also ordered residents to mostly stay at home, though it is still allowing most people to go to work and has not announced any punitive measures. Schools, restaurants and bars were ordered to close. The pace of new coronavirus infections reported in Europe accelerates daily roughly 6,000 on Thursday, 7,000 on Friday, 8,000 on Saturday, 9,000 on Sunday and 10,000 on Monday, bringing the total to about 62,000. France and Spain warned that their health care systems could be overwhelmed. And in Italy, still the hardest-hit country in Europe and the first to impose nationwide restrictions on movement, the government announced $28 billion in emergency aid to individuals, businesses and the health care system to stave off chaos and financial ruin. Italy had almost 28,000 infections and more than 1,800 deaths as of Monday.

The lobbying group for Americas biggest airlines called on the government on Monday to provide more than $50 billion in grants, loan guarantees and tax relief. The group, Airlines for America, warned that the current situation was not sustainable for the industry and that there was no end in sight to the crisis. This is a today problem, not a tomorrow problem, said Nicholas E. Calio, chief executive of Airlines for America. It requires urgent action. The industry group said that flight cancellations are outpacing new bookings and that the decline in demand is getting worse by the day. The request included $25 billion in grants for passenger carriers, $4 billion in grants for cargo, $25 billion in loan guarantees. On Sunday, United Airlines executives said they were in talks with union leaders about reducing payroll costs. The moves being considered include furloughs, pay cuts and reducing minimum hours.

In a sharp reversal, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday that everyone should avoid unnecessary travel and contact with others, should work at home and should stop going to places like bars, restaurants and theaters. Mr. Johnson called the measures very draconian, but he stopped well short of the kinds of steps taken by some harder-hit European countries. He did not order schools or businesses closed, did not tell people to stay in their homes, and said the steps were not mandatory, but rather giving very strong advice. Mr. Johnson and his government had faced harsh criticism for its laissez-faire approach to the pandemic. They had spoken hopefully of herd immunity in which many people would be infected, recover and then, it is hoped, be immune while it was inevitable that many people would take ill and die. But at a news conference on Monday with top medical officials, he said: Now is the time for everyone to stop nonessential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel. In particular, people over 70 and those with serious illnesses should avoid contact with others, Mr. Johnson said, suggesting that as a result, people should not visit nursing and retirement homes.

The Trump administration plans to immediately turn back all asylum seekers and other foreigners attempting to enter the United States from Mexico illegally, saying the nation cannot risk allowing the coronavirus to spread through detention facilities and Border Patrol agents, four administration officials said. The administration officials said the ports of entry would remain open to American citizens, green-card holders and foreigners with proper documentation. Some foreigners would be blocked, including Europeans currently subject to earlier travel restrictions imposed by the administration. The points of entry will also be open to commercial traffic. But under the new rule, set to be announced in the next 48 hours, Border Patrol agents would immediately return anyone to Mexico without any detainment and without any due process who attempts to cross the southwestern border between the legal ports of entry. The person would not be held for any length of time in an American facility. Although they advised that details could change before the announcement, administration officials said the measure was needed to avert what they fear could be a systemwide outbreak of the coronavirus inside detention facilities along the border. Such an outbreak could spread quickly through the immigrant population and could infect large numbers of Border Patrol agents, leaving the southwestern border defenses weakened, the officials argued. Unlock more free articles. Administration officials say many of the migrants who cross the border are already sick or lack sufficient documents detailing their medical history. Confirmed cases of the virus in Mexico stand at 82, compared with around 5,600 in the United States and more than 470 in Canada. But Mr. Trump has suggested closing the border many times in the past, hoping to crack down on illegal immigration and press Mexico to do more to curb the northward flow of migrants.

At least 100 deaths in the United States have now been linked to the coronavirus, according to a that is tracking and mapping every known case in the country as more people are tested. On Tuesday evening, West Virginia became the 50th state to report a case. The 101 deaths, all announced in the last three weeks, came as the number of known coronavirus cases in the United States soared past 5,600 on Tuesday. Hundreds more people are learning they have the illness each day, including more than 800 diagnoses on both Monday and Tuesday, as the nations testing capacity has grown significantly and as the virus spreads. About half the countrys reported deaths have been in Washington State, including at least 30 linked to a long-term care facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland. Residents of at least two more long-term care facilities in Washington, plus others in Kansas and South Carolina, have also died, underscoring the elevated risks for older adults and people with underlying health problems. Most of those who have died from the virus have been in their 60s or older, and several have been in their 90s. But other patients who died have been younger, including a corrections worker in New York City in his 50s and a man from the Seattle area in his 40s. Though Washington, New York and California account for about two-thirds of the countrys coronavirus deaths, 14 other states have reported at least one fatal case of the illness.

It was the most dramatic action on a day that the Continent continued to grapple with the growing coronavirus crisis, as some countries restricted the movements of their citizens and others proposed relief packages to try to contain the economic damage. Spains prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, announced a 200 billion relief aid package on Tuesday equivalent to one-fifth of Spains gross domestic product to help alleviate the economic impact of the pandemic. At least 491 people have died in the country and there have been 11,178 confirmed cases. The death of Spains youngest known victim so far, Francisco Garcia, 21, struck a chord with the nation. Mr. Garcia, a soccer coach from Malaga, did not know he had an underlying condition when he went to the hospital. But he was soon hit with a double dose of bad news: He was infected with the coronavirus and he had leukemia. He died on Sunday. In France, the government announced a relief package that would include postponing or slashing taxes, a government guarantee of loans for companies, and more than $1.1 billion for small businesses and independent contractors. Germany raced to bring home thousands of its citizens, its government spending more than $55 million on logistics and flights as nations tighten their borders and travel becomes exceedingly difficult. Turkey reported its first death caused by the coronavirus. And the Russian government prepared to block most foreigners from entering the country starting Wednesday. Moscow banned events of more than 50 people and ordered schools closed starting Saturday.

As the growing economic toll of the coronavirus became clearer, it supported the idea of sending cash payments directly to Americans as part of a broader $850 billion stimulus proposal that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin discussed on Tuesday with Republicans on Capitol Hill. It was a shift in priority for the administration, which has been advocating a payroll tax cut, and it came as the coronavirus ground large swaths of the economy to a halt. Mr. Mnuchin noted that the effects of a payroll tax cut would take months to reach people. He later told senators that about $250 billion of the stimulus plan would cover the cost of sending checks to Americans to replace about two weeks of their wages, according to people familiar with his proposal. The checks would go out by the end of April, and could be repeated if the crisis persists, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. After the session, Mr. Mnuchin declined to publicly put a dollar figure on the payments, telling reporters only that it is a big number. Earlier at the White House, he said the proposal would exclude the highest earners, like those making $1 million or more. 0:00/4:51.

But people across the country told us thats not the case. It started for me with a pretty severe sore throat. I started to feel symptomatic five days after traveling. Its different than the bronchitis that Ive gotten before. Everything had kind of settled in my lungs. And I was just coughing a ton. I had a headache and felt feverish. It felt like I had a bowling ball on my chest. Nobodys willing to see me, and nobody has the test kit and even C.D.C. is refusing to test me. I traced back, you know, my wife, she works at Amazon. They had a confirmed case. Four different planes in four different airports. So I dont know who sat next to me or who I was in contact with. Its one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. Its going to be just fine. Were going down, not up. Were going very substantially down. Not up. Anybody that needs a test, gets a test. Theyre there. They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful. We have a president saying anyone who wants tests can get a test. And Im thinking, That is so not true. It was just interesting, because there was this kind of gray area for a while of people who felt like they were really sick and should have been tested just as, even as a rule out. And the state of Washington just did not have the capacity to do that, because the government had not supported us at that point essentially. I got through to public health after about an hour, and they told me that I did not meet the criteria for being tested. They said, Theres no way to get tested. We dont have tests right now. Theres nothing set up in Delaware. I looked at the C.D.C. website and it said, call your doctor if you have the symptoms. So I called the doctors office and they told me to go to an urgent care facility. I called an urgent care facility and they said that theres nothing that they can do. And they dont have the tests. And they told me to go to the E.R. And I called a hospital, and they told me that they dont have the test either. I just felt like I was getting the run-around. It was clearly obvious that they just are under capacity, and theyre not able to test. I eventually just gave up because, at that point, the testing criteria was so strict. It was, you travel to China or have you been in contact with someone known diagnosed Covid. And I didnt meet any of that. As a nurse in an E.R., its pretty vital if I have an infectious disease that I know what it is because I could be spreading it to people who are really vulnerable.

Mr. Trump, who spent his morning heckling governors on Twitter, struck a tone of coordination and cooperation in the briefing room. He said many of his administrations actions have been intended to bolster the economy. Mr. Mnuchin also said that Mr. Trump had instructed him to allow taxpayers to put off paying income taxes that are due April 15 for 90 days without penalty or interest. The Trump administration is also supporting a request for $50 billion in economic relief for the airline industry as part of the broader package.

This Fed facility ensures that companies can get the overnight funding they need to meet short-term obligations like payroll, said Ernie Tedeschi, policy economist at Evercore ISI. There were signs of support in Congress for the idea of sending direct payments to ordinary people. A group of Senate Democrats, led by Michael Bennet of Colorado, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, had earlier proposed legislation to send as much as $4,500 to nearly every adult and child in the United States this year, as part of a sustained government income-support program.

Experts say the from touching those materials is still low, though they offered additional warnings about how long the virus could survive in the air, which may have important implications for medical workers. When the virus becomes suspended in droplets smaller than five micrometers known as aerosols it can stay suspended for about 30 minutes, before drifting down and settling on surfaces where it can linger for hours, the researchers said. The finding is inconsistent with the World Health Organizations position that the virus is not transported by air. The new study also suggests that the virus can survive up to 24 hours on cardboard packages, though it disintegrates over the course of a day meaning cardboard packages that arrive in the mail would have only low levels of the virus unless the delivery person has coughed or sneezed on it or has handled it with contaminated hands.

Nearly all flights scheduled to take off from or land at the airport after 6 p.m. were canceled, according to the airports website, which indicated that more than 177 flights had been halted in the last 24 hours. The tower closure was described by the F.A.A. as temporary, but it was unclear when the airport would resume normal operations. The citys more popular airport, OHare, sees more than four times the amount of traffic that Midway does each day. Most airlines have announced cuts to international flights because of a sudden drop in demand, and airlines have asked the government for a bailout and banks for billions in loans. And across the country, public transit agencies have struggled amid low ridership and health concerns from their employees and customers. New York Citys public transportation system, the largest in North America, is as the pandemic set off an extraordinary free fall in ridership. In a letter on Tuesday to New Yorks congressional delegation, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the citys subway and buses and two commuter railroads, said that subway ridership had plunged 60 percent and bus ridership had fallen 49 percent on Monday compared with the same day last year. Bus service in Detroit was halted after drivers, fearing for their safety, balked at leaving their garages. Glenn Tolbert, the president of Amalgamated Transit Union Local 26, which represents the Detroit bus drivers, said that some drivers had reported to work early in the morning and found that the buses were not adequately cleaned. He also said restrictions on businesses and hospitals had deprived the drivers of places on their routes to visit restrooms and wash their hands. We just didnt feel that the city, although they were making an effort, was doing enough to protect us and the public, Mr. Tolbert said.

A new Harvard analysis shows that many parts of the United States would have if the new coronavirus continues to spread widely and nothing is done to expand capacity. In 40 percent of markets around the country, hospitals would not be able to make enough room for all Covid-19 patients even if they were completely emptied of other patients. That statistic assumes that 40 percent of all adults become infected with the virus over 12 months, a scenario described as moderate by the team behind the calculations. Around the country, hospitals have begun canceling elective operations and speeding patients with less critical ailments home, to make beds available for possible coronavirus patients. Yet the Harvard estimates suggest that much more may be needed. In hard-hit Italy, hospitals have resorted to for older patients who are severely ill with the virus. INTERACTIVE.

Stocks rose on Tuesday, lifted by the latest emergency measure from the Federal Reserve to keep money flowing through the economy and talk of further stimulus efforts in Washington. They made up some of the ground lost on Monday in the sharpest drop since the coronavirus outbreak began. The S&P 500 rose about 6 percent after a 12 percent plunge on Monday, its steepest drop since 1987. But the tone of the trading was tentative. The best-performing parts of the market were traditionally safe and staid sectors like utilities and consumer staples, where risk-averse investors hide during trying economic times. Reflecting concern about the global economy, oil prices fell. There are few historical parallels for the market shock waves created by the outbreak. From still-closed factories in China to Western nations where millions of people are living in a state of semi-house arrest, most of the engines that keep the global economy aloft have sputtered to a halt at the same time.

Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City said that residents should prepare for the possibility of a shelter in place order to be announced in the next 48 hours, as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in New York City neared 1,000. Mr. de Blasio said that a decision on such an order, which would require coordination between the city and New York State, had not been made. But he said he believed that kind of recommendation, which is in place in San Francisco, would be the right guidance. New York City has already come to a halt, but a shelter in place recommendation would be a major escalation in restrictions on public life. The mayor did not elaborate on what such an order would look like in practice. Mr. de Blasio said the city was also rushing to add more hospital beds.

Mick Mulvaney, the outgoing acting White House chief of staff, is in self-quarantine in his home state of South Carolina, after his niece, with whom he shares an apartment in Washington, fell ill and is awaiting test results, according to four people familiar with the matter. Mr. Mulvaney took a test for the coronavirus last week and the results were negative, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. But the results of the test that his niece, Maggie, took are not back yet, the person said. Mr. Mulvaneys niece is a professional fund-raiser who works on a team led by Kimberly Guilfoyle, the head of the Trump Victory finance effort.

Volunteers wait to check temperatures at the entrance of a street in Beijing, on Wednesday.Credit...Giulia Marchi for The New York Times. China reports zero local infections, a major turning point. For the first time since the coronavirus crisis began, China on Thursday reported no new local infections for the previous day, a milestone in its costly battle with the outbreak that has since become a pandemic, upending daily life and economic activity around the world. Officials said 34 new coronavirus cases had been confirmed, all involving people who had come to China from elsewhere. In signaling that an end to Chinas epidemic might be in sight, the announcement could pave the way for officials to focus more on reviving the countrys economy, which nearly ground to a halt after the government imposed travel restrictions and quarantine measures. In recent days, economic life has been resuming in fits and starts. Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak. The virus has infected more than 874,300 people in at least 171 countries. But China is not out of danger yet. Experts have said that it will need to see at least 14 consecutive days without new infections for the outbreak to be considered truly over. It remains to be seen whether the virus will re-emerge once daily life restarts and travel restrictions are lifted around the country. Unlock more free articles. Its very clear that the actions taken in China have almost brought to an end their first wave of infections, said Ben Cowling, a professor and head of the division of epidemiology and biostatistics at Hong Kong Universitys School of Public Health. The question is what will happen if theres a second wave, because the kind of measures that China has implemented are not necessarily sustainable in the long term. To contain the outbreak, the authorities shut schools and workplaces and imposed travel and quarantine restrictions on broad swaths of the population and many visitors from abroad. Since January, more than 50 million people in the central province of Hubei, including its capital, Wuhan, where the outbreak began, have been subjected to a strict lockdown. LIMITED SPREAD. .ur full article about . ICE says it will make only mission critical arrests until the crisis passes. An ICE team in Hawthorne, Calif., this month.Credit...Lucy Nicholson/Reuters. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced on Wednesday that it would stop making arrests, except for those that are considered mission critical, until after the coronavirus crisis had passed. Fear of an outbreak inside the agencys detention centers is growing. At some facilities, detainees are being held in their cells for up to 21 hours a day, including during mealtimes measures, according to officials, that are necessary to prevent the spread the coronavirus. But in other centers, requests for hot water or cleaning supplies are being denied because the items can be considered dangerous contraband. No cases of the coronavirus have been reported in the detention centers and jails that house detained immigrants across the country. But 10 immigrant detainees at a contract detention center in Aurora, Colo., have been cohorted in an isolated dorm since Tuesday and were being closely monitored, the agency said. The more than 37,000 people detained by the agency could be especially vulnerable if cases appear because of the tight living quarters, communal bathrooms and large, open cafeterias. And yet the measures intended to contain the virus have not only created greater discomfort in places where inmates say conditions are harsh in the best of times, but are also producing anxiety and fear. At the Bergen County Jail in New Jersey, where ICE takes many immigrants it detains in New York City, fears of getting sick were stoked by the sight of an ill detainee who was removed by people in Hazmat suits last weekend, one inmate told his wife. The sick man was later returned to the unit without explanation. When ICE was continuing to make arrests, fears had been heightened by the arrival of newly detained men, another said on Wednesday. Many ICE detainees say they feel like sitting ducks who will inevitably be infected. The officials here have not said anything to us about what is happening outside, or any extra precautions that we should take, said a 40-year-old man from the Congo who is detained in a Karnes City, Texas, facility. Senator Mitch McConnell walking to the Senate floor on Wednesday.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times. Trump signed a bill providing paid sick leave, free testing and other benefits. A relief package to provide sick leave, unemployment benefits, free coronavirus testing, and food and medical aid to people affected by the pandemic was signed into law by President Trump on Wednesday evening after the Senate passed it by a wide margin. It was approved by the House last week. The Senate vote was 90 to 8, after the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, urged conservatives who disliked the bill to gag and vote for it anyway. This is a time for urgent bipartisan action, and in this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers, Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor Wednesday morning. Lawmakers and the White House are already drafting another economic stabilization package that would send direct payments to taxpayers and provide loans to businesses. Updated 5m ago. More live coverage: . We are moving rapidly because the situation demands it, Mr. McConnell said. An outline of the new package, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, calls for a total of $1 trillion in spending, which would also include $50 billion for secured loans for the airline industry, and another $150 billion for secured loans or loan guarantees for other parts of the economy. 0:00/1:45. This Is a Time to Be Bold, Schumer Says. The Senate raced to respond to the coronavirus pandemic with an economic stabilization package, and lawmakers braced for potential travel restrictions. Our nation faced this serious challenge. But, working together, we can take bold steps to combat it. Earlier this month, Congress passed billions in urgent funding for public health and small businesses, and this Senate majority remains committed to taking further bold steps to preserve and protect the economic foundations. This is not some rescue following risky business decisions. Nobody thinks any of this is the fault of small businesses. So while I will support the House bill in order to secure some emergency relief for some American workers, I will not adjourn the Senate until we have passed a far bolder package that must include significant relief for small businesses all across our country. Certain industries are struggling airlines, hotels but we must make sure that we prioritize public health and workers over corporate bailouts. And if there is going to be a discussion about a bailout, it must include worker priorities and protections. Now a few of my Republican colleagues have proposed a one time cash payment of $1,000. But my fellow Americans, this is not a time for small thinking. This is not a time for small measures. This is a time to be bold, to be aggressive. The president suggests that this recession could last through the summer. A thousand dollars goes by pretty quickly if youre unemployed. In contrast, expanded unemployment insurance, beefed up unemployment insurance, covers you for a much longer time and would provide a much bigger safety net. 00:00. 1:45. 1:45This Is a Time to Be Bold, Schumer Says.

It would allow the Exchange Stabilization Fund, an emergency reserve account that is usually used for currency market interventions, to be tapped to cover those costs, and also temporarily guarantee money-market mutual funds. Lawmakers were moving swiftly to assemble those and other proposals into legislation, but the details remained far from complete. The Treasury Department proposal calls for two rounds of checks sent directly to American taxpayers on April 6 and May 18. Payments would depend on the recipients income and family size, the summary said. Each round would disburse $250 billion. Two members of Congress test positive for the coronavirus. For the first time, the legions of infected Americans include sitting members of Congress: Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida, who was on the House floor as recently as early Saturday morning, and Representative Ben McAdams, Democrat of Utah. In a statement, Mr. Diaz-Balart said he had developed symptoms later Saturday and received a positive test result on Wednesday. He has been working from his apartment in Washington in self-quarantine, he said, and did not plan to return home to avoid exposing his family. He said his wife, Tia, had underlying conditions that put her at exceptionally high risk. I want everyone to know that I am feeling much better, Mr. Diaz-Balart said. However, it is important that everyone take this extremely seriously and follow C.D.C. guidelines in order to avoid getting sick and mitigate the spread of this virus. We must continue to work together to emerge stronger as a country during these trying times. Mr. McAdams said in a statement that he developed cold-like symptons at home on Saturday night after returning from Washington, and isolated himself. He later developed a fever, dry cough and labored breathing, and learned Wednesday that his test results were positive. He said he would continue working from home until it was safe to end his self-quarantine. Several other members of Congress have said after interacting with people who tested positive for the coronavirus. They include Senator Ted Cruz of Texas; ; Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona; Representative Doug Collins of Georgia; Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina; and Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, all Republicans.

The, issued Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that as in other countries the oldest patients were at greatest risk of becoming seriously ill or dying. But of the 508 coronavirus patients known to have been hospitalized in the U.S., 38 percent were notably younger between 20 and 54. And nearly half of the 121 sickest patients studied those who were admitted to intensive care units were adults under 65. I think everyone should be paying attention to this, said Stephen S. Morse, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University. Its not just going to be the elderly. There will be people age 20 and up. Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the Trump administrations coronavirus task force, appealed on Wednesday for people of the millennial generation to stop socializing in groups and to take care to protect themselves and others. You have the potential then to spread it to someone who does have a condition that none of us knew about, and cause them to have a disastrous outcome, Dr. Birx said. In the C.D.C. report, 20 percent of the hospitalized patients and 12 percent of the intensive care patients were between the ages of 20 and 44, basically spanning the millennial generation. STRIKING THE YOUNG. A promising treatment fails, and the W.H.O. announces international trial. Antiviral drugs that held promise as a in one of the first major studies in seriously ill patients, researchers from China reported on Wednesday. No benefit was observed, the researchers wrote in . The study tested Kaletra, a combination of two antiviral medicines, lopinavir and ritonavir, that are normally used to treat H.I.V. There is no proven drug treatment for the new coronavirus, and doctors around the world have been desperately testing an array of medicines in hopes of finding something that will help patients, especially those who are severely ill. While the results were disappointing, the researchers said that this one study was not the last word, and suggested that more studies might determine whether the drugs would work if given earlier in the illness or in combination with other medicines. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization announced an international trial to figure out which antiviral drugs may be most effective. The research, called the , will take place in hospitals in several countries, including Argentina, Bahrain, Canada, France, Iran, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland and Thailand.

President Trump moved Wednesday to send military hospital ships to areas hard-hit by the coronavirus, and invoked a law allowing the federal government to order American manufacturers to make critically needed medical equipment, like ventilators, respirators and protective gear for health care workers. The Trump administrations slow initial response to the global crisis left the United States facing , equipment and available hospital beds. At a White House briefing, Mr. Trump said that he would invoke the law, the Defense Production Act, just in case we need it. The president said he had dispatched two military hospitals ships to help with the crisis one to New York, the other to the West Coast but officials later said it would be weeks before the New York-bound one would arrive. A federal plan to combat the coronavirus, which was shared with The New York Times, warned that shortages of medical supplies like protective gear and pharmaceuticals could occur, impacting health care, emergency services, and other elements of critical infrastructure. Hospitals around the country are warning of critical shortages of supplies. Several states are building makeshift hospitals to meet the growing need for beds for coronavirus patients. In Washington State, King County is turning a soccer field into a tented hospital with 200 beds. The actions are meant to preserve local hospital beds for the most severe cases, the county, which includes Seattle, said in a statement. This is a rapidly evolving situation that requires quick and decisive action, it said. Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon said a 250-bed hospital would be set up on the state fairgrounds in Salem by Friday. State officials are also looking to identify 1,000 temporary hospital beds for recovering patients without the coronavirus, which would free up space for coronavirus patients. There is no single right protocol, Ms. Brown said on Wednesday. We are constantly getting new information, and constantly escalating decisions as infections rise.

Some of these high-profile people say they are feeling ill and had good reason to be tested. Others argue that those who were found to be infected and then isolated themselves provided a good example to the public. But with testing still in short supply in areas of the country, leaving health care workers and many sick people unable to get diagnoses, some prominent personalities have obtained tests without exhibiting symptoms or having known contact with someone who has the virus, as required by some testing guidelines. Others have refused to specify how they were tested. Such cases have provoked accusations of elitism and preferential treatment about a testing system that has already been plagued with delays and confusion, and now stirred a new national debate that has reached the White House with President Trump at a Wednesday news conference whether the well-connected go to the front of the line. Youd have to ask them that question, he replied, suggesting that should not be the case. Perhaps thats been the story of life. That does happen on occasion, and Ive noticed where some people have been tested fairly quickly. The question burst into public view this week after the Brooklyn Nets announced Tuesday that four of their players including Kevin Durant, one of the biggest stars in the N.B.A. had tested positive. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York crictized the dynamic, that while he wished the athletes a speedy recovery, he did not think the N.B.A. should be getting tests for its athletes while critically ill patients were kept waiting.

Financial markets reeled again on Wednesday, as governments ramped up efforts to contain the virus and investors waited for lawmakers in Washington to take action on proposals to bolster the American economy. It was one more in a daily series of extreme swings in sentiment on Wall Street. Stocks had jumped on Tuesday after called for pumping $1 trillion into the economy. News that the Senate approved a bill to provide sick leave, jobless benefits, free coronavirus testing and other aid stemmed some of Wednesdays losses late in the day. But when all was said and done, the S&P 500 had fallen about 5 percent, stocks in Europe were sharply lower and oil prices cratered. The American oil benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, dropped 24 percent to just over $21 a barrel, the lowest price since 2003. The global Brent benchmark fell to just above $25 a barrel, a level just below January 2016. Oil prices are more than 60 percent below where they were at the beginning of the year. The American economy is poised for its worst quarterly contraction on record, with a sudden slowdown in economic activity that is more akin to what happened in wartime Europe than during previous American slowdowns like the financial crisis more than a decade ago or even the Great Depression.

For the latest financial news . Russian coronavirus disinformation campaign is hitting Europe, E.U. says. Russia and media outlets affiliated with the Kremlin have begun a significant disinformation campaign against the West, spreading misinformation about the coronavirus outbreak that has already had real-life consequences in Europe, according to an internal European Union document examined by The New York Times. The report, dated March 18, said that Russia-backed misinformation has sparked rioting in Ukraine and has driven people to buy potentially dangerous bogus remedies. It said Russia was pushing a false narrative that the virus was being brought to Europe by migrants. The overarching aim of Kremlin disinformation is to aggravate the public health crisis in Western countries, specifically by undermining public trust in national health care systems thus preventing an effective response to the outbreak, the document said. The Kremlin denied the allegations on Wednesday. The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry S. Peskov told reporters that they were groundless accusations, according to Tass, the Russian state news agency. The E.U. report presents findings from strategic communications experts and researchers who have scoured the internet, social media and traditional news platforms for evidence of this type of coordinated action and for evidence that Russia is behind it. Western intelligence officials have said for years that President Vladimir Putin of Russia uses propaganda and disinformation as a way to sow suspicion and undermine confidence in democratic institutions. Russias campaign has targeted American and European elections and alliances like NATO and the European Union. As the virus spreads through the Middle East, concern rises about its potential toll.

As governments in the Middle East enact emergency measures to slow the spread of the virus, closing borders and grounding flights, many are bracing for what they fear could become a crisis in places wracked by war and instability. Oil-wealthy Gulf countries with Western-style health care systems are best positioned to combat the virus. But the response will be curtailed by crumbling health services and weak economies in some countries; war and densely packed refugee camps in others. Outside of with more than 17,000 cases, a swath of countries stretching from Morocco to Oman have so far declared only a small percentage of the worlds cases. The greatest concentration thus far is in wealthy Qatar, where the virus has swept through camps of migrant laborers, mostly from the Indian subcontinent, and the tally reached 442 cases on Wednesday. In the most vulnerable parts of the Middle East, there are worries the virus has spread undetected. had confirmed 164 cases. War-torn Libya, Yemen and Syria have yet to declare a single case.

Egypt and Algeria, which has 72 cases, will end all commercial flights on Thursday, although Egypt says that foreign tourists will be able to leave after that date on planes that arrive empty. Elsewhere in the region, Israel, which has more than 430 cases, closed its borders to all foreign nationals on Wednesday, with some exceptions. The authorities stepped up as lawmakers debated a mandatory lockdown. The crossings to the Palestinian territories have generally been closed. The Palestinian Authority has reported 44 cases, most in the West Bank city of Bethlehem. In Afghanistan, the American commander is , American and European officials said. The planning reflects growing concerns about the spread of the coronavirus there in recent days. The Taliban, which control large parts of the country, have started requiring Afghans traveling from Iran to prove that they have been screened before being allowed to return to their homes.

"19 March, 2020","Virus Hits Europe Harder Than China. Is That the Price of an Open Society?. The epidemic is now bigger in Europe, where governments arent used to giving harsh orders, and citizens arent used to following them. Patients arriving at a newly opened Covid-19 hospital wing in Rome on Thursday.Credit...Nadia Shira Cohen for The New York Times. By . March 19, 2020. 44. The macabre milestones keep coming. By Wednesday, Europe had recorded more coronavirus cases and fatalities than China. On Thursday, Italy by itself passed China in reported deaths. While China claims to have lowered its rate of new cases essentially to zero, Europes numbers grow faster each day about 100,000 confirmed infections and 5,000 deaths in all so far suggesting that the worst is yet to come. So how is it that the new disease, Covid-19, has hit harder in Europe, which had weeks of warning that the epidemic was coming, than in China, where the virus originated and where there are twice as many people?. To some extent, experts say, Europeans are paying a price for living in open, affluent democracies, where people are used to free movement, easy travel and independent decision-making, and where governments worry about public opinion. Governments arent used to giving harsh orders, and citizens arent used to following them. But China acted with a severity and breadth that stunned the West, making unpopular moves and accepting deep economic damage as the price of containing the disease. It closed off tens of millions of people, prohibiting them from leaving their cities and even their homes, except to get food and medical care, and it imposed lesser restrictions on hundreds of millions, shutting down whole industries in the process. China has been willing to go to pretty extraordinary lengths, using the army, using the police, locking people in their homes, using drone technology to monitor behavior, setting up roadblocks, said Dr. Arthur L.

Whatever measures have been put in place in Europe really have only been put in place recently, and frankly, and none of them has been as draconian and all-encompassing as what was done in Wuhan, Dr. Reingold said. The consistency and reliability of the numbers from China and some other countries have been questioned, but the overall situation and its direction are clear. While China stumbled in the early going local and regional officials attempted to censor any talk of an outbreak, and medical gear was in critically short supply it then addressed the crisis seriously. The coercive power of an authoritarian government was only one factor. , and an assertive combination of widespread testing, quarantines for the sick and the quick tracking of their contacts to contain the outbreak without shutting down the economy.

Frieden, a former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While China lost precious weeks in the beginning, it then moved faster and more decisively than Western countries have. China imposed its first big lockdown, , on Jan. 23, less than a month after local officials there conceded that they were facing a new pathogen, and barely two weeks after the virus was identified. When Wuhan was closed off, there were fewer than 600 confirmed infections worldwide, though testing had barely begun.

I have reservations about some measures they implemented, but they controlled the epidemic, Francois Balloux, an epidemiologist at University College London, on Thursday. Doing so, they gave the world a window of opportunity to prepare, which was squandered.

Europes first effort to rope off a broad area Italys much less stringently enforced took effect on March 8, when the country had reported more than 7,300 cases. Spain and France had similar caseloads the following week, when they chose to ban most public outings nationwide. You have to do strict social distancing within a week of the start of community transmission, otherwise you get an explosion, and once you get that explosion, its very hard to contain, Dr. Frieden said. The key is not to get to that point, and much of Europe is beyond that point, and New York is beyond that point. An almost empty plaza in Milan on Thursday.Credit...Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times. Some parts of East Asia acted quickly, but with a very different strategy than Chinas or Europes: aggressive testing and contact-tracing to stop the chain of transmission, without shutting down economic activity. As a result, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong have had few cases, and South Korea, which has tested more than 200,000 people, has brought a large outbreak under control. South Korea showed to the world that it can allow curtailing a pandemic with limited infringements to individual freedom and disruption to the economy and the fabric of society, . But that strategy, Dr. Reingold said, is a herculean undertaking, very resource-intensive and one that the United States, in particular, could not replicate. Theres still a long way to go before testing is readily available here, he said. Epidemiologists also say that wide-scale testing and contact-tracing, like social distancing, work best in containing an outbreak when they are used before the contagion is spreading out of control. Put another way, the best response to a serious outbreak is the one that will draw accusations, at first, that the government is overreacting. But experts say it is often impossible to know at the outset which outbreaks are serious. If Italys lockdown measures are effective at preventing new infections, it will not become evident in the numbers for a few more days, at least, experts say. In other countries, which took those measures later, the benefit will show up later. At its peak in early February, China reported 3,000 to 4,000 new confirmed infections per day. Italy is now adding cases faster than that, and Europes caseload grows by well over 10,000 daily. On Thursday, Italy reported about 41,000 infections and 3,400 deaths. The countrys caseload could double by the end of March and pass Chinas official tally, experts say, and other countries might follow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New Yorks governor has sharply limited outdoor activity across the state, including by ordering nonessential businesses to keep all of their workers home.Credit...Benjamin Norman for The New York Times. TRACKING THE OUTBREAK. Soon more than 1 in 5 Americans will be under orders to stay mostly indoors. One by one, localities and now some of the nations biggest states are beginning to limit peoples movements as they struggle to try to curb the spread of the before fast-growing caseloads overwhelm their hospitals. In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo moved Friday to sharply limit outdoor activity across the state, including by ordering nonessential businesses to keep all of their workers home. His wide-ranging executive order, which takes effect on Sunday at 8 p.m., was issued as the number of known cases in the state jumped to over 7,800. These provisions will be enforced, Mr. Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. These are not helpful hints. Unlock more free articles. Then, within the space of an hour Friday afternoon, several other big states followed suit. Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut issued an order similar to Mr. Cuomos, and Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey said he planned to order on Saturday that all nonessential businesses in that state shut down as well. And in Illinois, Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced a statewide stay at home order on Friday, asking all 12 million residents to leave the house only when necessary. All nonessential businesses must also stop operating under the order, which is effective at 5 p.m. Saturday. I dont come to this decision easily, Mr. Pritzker said at an afternoon news conference. I fully recognize that, in some cases, I am choosing between peoples lives and saving peoples livelihood. But ultimately, you cant have a livelihood if you dont have your life. Their moves were announced as California woke up Friday to new rules closing the states nonessential retail shops and sharply limiting outdoor movement, after Gov. Gavin Newsom all 40 million of them to stay in their houses as much as possible. There was initially confusion there over how the order would be enforced and interpreted, but Californians were told they could still take walks and leave their neighborhoods to hike or go to the beach, as long as they were able to practice social distancing. Mayor LaToya Cantrell of New Orleans also issued a stay-at-home order on Friday, asking the citys 390,000 residents to go out for critical needs only. States and localities announced the new rules as the death toll in the United States surpassed 200, and as Massachusetts and Washington, D.C., recorded their first deaths. There have now been deaths in more than half the states, with the most in Washington State, New York and . New York will allow healthy people under age 70 to go out for groceries and medicines, and to exercise and walk outside, as long as they stay six feet away from others. Mass transit will continue to run so that health care workers and other people with essential jobs can get to work, but people will be urged not to use it unless absolutely necessary. Nonessential gatherings of any size will be banned. And certain essential businesses will be allowed to remain open, : grocers, health care providers, pharmacies, gas stations, convenience stores, banks, hardware stores, laundromats, child-care providers, auto repair, utilities, warehouses and distributors, plumbers and other skilled contractors, animal-care providers, transportation providers, construction companies and many kinds of manufacturers.

New York Business Owner. Everything is running slow. Were doing half of what were used to doing this morning, 50% less than before. Easily 60%. Michael Barbaro. Across America, businesses are scaling back, firing workers and shutting their doors because of the coronavirus. Stella Tan. Have you ever seen it like this before?. New York Business Owner. No, Ive never seen it before. Never, never in my life. This is a serious epidemic. Michael Barbaro. In New York City, that started in Chinatown. Reporter. Stories of economic downturn, even discrimination against Chinese communities, are coming to light across the country. Michael Barbaro. Fueled by anxiety. Reporter. Here in New York City, business owners in Chinatown say sales are down because of widespread fear. Michael Barbaro. Within days it had expanded to the entire city by order of the government.

Its Friday, March 20. New York Business Owner. Hello. Stella Tan. Hi. Speaker. What channel is this?. Stella Tan. The New York Times. Speaker. New York Times?. Stella Tan. Podcast. New York Business Owner. Yeah, whats up, guys? Good morning, guys. Stella Tan. So this is Stella Tan. Its Sunday, March 15, and I am in Manhattans Chinatown. There are some souvenir shops open, a few bakeries and restaurants open, but also a fair number of places are closed with their gates pulled down in front or with cardboard over their windows. Im about to meet the owner of this restaurant, Amazing 66, and I am just getting to the front of the restaurant right now. Hello. Helen Ng. Hello. Stella Tan. Hi, Helen. Nice to meet you. Helen Ng. Hi, Stella. Stella Tan. We just did an elbow bump. Helen Ng. Yeah. Today is still a little early, but 12:00, usually, the lunch crowd should be coming in. But now, see, we only have one person at one table. Thats an empty restaurant. My name is Helen Ng, and I am the restaurant owner of Amazing 66 on Mott Street in Manhattan. I was actually born in Hong Kong, and I came over to United States with my family and four other siblings in 1969. Im 12 years old at the time. My parents started working in the garment manufactory. I honestly say that I started working here underage the third day that I get to the United States. I go to school, and then I go to the garment manufactory to work after school. Stella Tan. And how long have you been running this restaurant?. Helen Ng. This is in my 14th year. Since the business keeps going down and my staff is worried about the transportation when theyre traveling, I guess I have no choice but to decide to close up the restaurant as of tomorrow, the 16th. And of course I dont really like it and I dont want to, but I have no choice. Its sad, you know? I mean, as I told my staff, I say, theyre like a family to me. So if I dont see them, I feel that Im not home. But I hope this virus will go away soon and everybody be healthy. Stella Tan. And whats the food that youre going to miss the most from your restaurant?. Helen Ng. From my restaurant? So many of them, you know? I have the pumpkin with the short rib. I have the chicken with garlic shallots. I have the lobster with cheese, and so many, so many. Stella Tan. Well, I hope you can reopen and eat all those foods again soon with your staff and your family. Helen Ng. Thank you. I hope everybody can reopen to make Chinatown blossom again, you know, more people come back there. I just want to see the street thats full of people instead of empty. Thats the most important. All right, well, nice meeting you. Stella Tan. Very nice to meet you. Good luck. And Ill definitely come back when it re-opens. Helen Ng. Oh, boo. Stella Tan. OK. Helen Ng. I hope I see you again soon, OK?. Bye. Archived Recording. While there are closures and cancellations throughout New York City, there are big crowds outside grocery stores. They are lined up around the block on the Upper West Side. The most challenging spot in any neighborhood right now the grocery store. Regular shoppers rarely see this big a crowd here. Long lines of anxious shoppers have left shelves bare everywhere. Alexandra Leigh Young. OK, so this is Alex. Its about 2:30 PM on a Sunday afternoon, and Im standing in front of this market in my neighborhood called Halsey Traders Market, and its kind of like a cross between a small grocery store and what we call a bodega. Its not a full-service grocery store, but you can come here to get a few toiletries, or some vegetables, whatever you need for the night. Yeah, Im going to go in and Im going to see whats going on there. So I just walked in the front door, and theres a lot of people here right now. So theres about three little counters where people are checking out. Each one is pretty busy right now. Theres a line behind each one of them. I see this one woman right here at the counter. Shes buying a lot of cleaning products, like Lysol wipes and sprays. Hey. Are you JuJu? Nice to meet you. Im not going to shake your hand, if thats OK. Juju. Im not going to shake your hand either. Alexandra Leigh Young. Great, OK. Can I get you to just say your name and what you do here real quick?. Juju. Yeah, sure. My name is JuJu. Ive been supervising this store and the Key Food down there for the past 10 years, and Ive never seen anything like this. Its just the sheer volume of customers shopping at the same time. You would think like perishable items wouldnt be moving. I have no eggs. Yogurt is running out. Meat is running out. Alexandra Leigh Young. What did it feel like for you when you saw the line starting to get really crazy? What were you thinking in your head?. Juju. I was nerve-wracked. I was extremely stressed. Like, yesterday I went so unprepared, bags under my eyes. Im working 19 hours sometimes. Yeah, Ill get like a half hour of sleep. My employees are overworked. Im overworked. Im shaking as Im speaking to you now because Im nervous. Alexandra Leigh Young. Your leg is shaking?. Juju. Im tired. Im very tired. You know, Im a cashier for five minutes, Im stocking meat for five minutes. Im doing everything. At one point in time there was a few shoplifters. I swear to God, I didnt even have time talk to them. I was like I tapped them on the shoulder, have a good day, enjoy. Alexandra Leigh Young. What were they stealing?. Juju. Soap. Alexandra Leigh Young. Soap. Juju. What do you if somebody is desperate enough to steal soap, what do you do? Have a good day, man. I dont know if you see my eye twitching. I feel like my eye is twitching. Alexandra Leigh Young. Cant tell. Juju. You know, for the past 30 years, my familys been around over here operating. My dad is 72 years old. When he comes around here, people recognize him. So you feel bad for people. You really want to help. Speaker. How you doing?. Juju. Whats going on, brother? We have no garlic. We have no onion. We have no our refrigerators are empty. Our walk-in boxes are empty. For as long as I know my entire life, Boars Head never delivers on Sunday. They dont deliver on Saturday either. They close Saturday and Sunday. Alexandra Leigh Young. Boars Head is the lunch meat?. Juju. Yes, the delicatessen meats, and most popular in New York. And I called the guy yesterday and I was like, hey, listen, we dont have anything. And the guys like, you know we dont deliver on Sunday ever, right? I told him, I was like, look, if you have any common sense as a businessman, and if you have a heart, youd get your ass up this morning, all right? And you deliver food, all right? Because people are running out. He called me this morning at 7:00 in the morning. Hes like, hey, Im in front of the store. And he had a full truck. So he didnt just come serve me. Boars Head is a really big company, but each route owner is independent. So thats where I wanted to come from. This guy got up, left his family to do something like that. Thats something I appreciated a lot. Alexandra Leigh Young. When you said that you saw this line and you were nerve-wracked and you were panicked, what was the worst fear that was going through your head? Like, what were you specifically panicked about?. Juju. That people wouldnt do what I was doing, the deep breaths, that people would start fighting each other, and that we would have to handle that. Like, wheres the support that we should have from our government, right? In that scenario, what am I supposed to do, put my own life in danger, or one of my guys?. Alexandra Leigh Young. Over toilet paper or something. Juju. Over toilet paper or something. Like if, hypothetically speaking, we are the only businesses, will we have police officers standing outside supporting us? Will we have fire department people just sticking around, just more bodies around? Is there going to be a National Guard? If that case does happen these are all worst-case scenarios, but these are the only things I would think about moving forward. Everything that weve dealt with, the sleep deprivation, my own personal issues, all these things, Im all right. Right? But if it goes a few steps further, what do we do?. Archived Recording. The United States is starting to shut down as millions of Americans are working from home. Now thousands of schools have closed, millions of Americans are working from home. When you avoid public places, you hurt sales at restaurants, retailers, malls. Youve seen the impact. Weve talked to Uber and Lyft drivers. Theyve seen a 70% drop off from their sales from the last few weeks. Jessica Cheung. Hey, this is Jessica Cheung. Its Monday, March 16. Im on the Upper West Side, and Im actually standing in the lobby of my apartment building waiting for a Lyft, because I wanted to talk to one of the many workers who are still working during this pandemic. There are people who cant work from home. There are people who might not have paid sick rules, and I wanted to ask them what its like to be working during this time. Hi. Raul?. Raul Giansante. How are you?. Jessica Cheung. Im good. How are you?. Raul Giansante. OK. Pick up. You want to close the window?. Jessica Cheung. No, we should probably leave it open, right?. Raul Giansante. Yeah. I always keep one window open. Jessica Cheung. Yeah. I see that you have a can of Lysol spray, a can of Lysol wipes, hand sanitizer on your cup holder and youre wearing a mask. Raul Giansante. Right. Im 75 years old. I have diabetes. I have chronic bronchitis. So there are two very bad conditions for the virus. I have to protect myself, and I have to protect you. I think that it should be mandatory for every taxi driver to have a mask, because would pick up around 30 to 35 people a day. And only one person with the virus can contagious about 35 people. Thats terrible. My name is Raul Giansante. Im originally from Argentina. Im in this country for 47 years. And all my life, my work was to do custom hand-carved frames with gold leaf for artists and museums and art galleries. But three years ago, I fell in the street. I have an herniated desk. So the only position that Im not in pain is when Im sitting. The only thing that I could find out that I can be sitting and make money is a taxi. And Im so happy that Im doing this, because in 47 years of living in New York, I discover in six months more than I did in 47 years. Jessica Cheung. Oh, what did you discover?. Raul Giansante. Many places in Brooklyn. I didnt know much about Brooklyn. Many places beautiful gardens, beautiful buildings all over the city that I never expect that are going to be here and that I was going to be able to see something like this. And now I can see everything. Now I have the opportunity to see everything. Jessica Cheung. Can you tell me how business is doing for you?. Raul Giansante. Very slow. Usually when I work in the morning, I drive many parents with the kids to schools. At night, when I work Saturdays and Sundays and Friday nights, usually I pick up between 35 and 45 people. Yesterday, I went out to work, I pick up, on the whole day, 11 people. So its really slow, and this is affecting everybody. Jessica Cheung. Given that you have so many risks of getting the virus, why are you still working?. Raul Giansante. Because to tell you the truth, because the retirement in the United States is so low that its not enough to buy food. So I have to work. Jessica Cheung. If you stopped working, what would happen?. Raul Giansante. I have no idea, because I wont have enough money to pay rent, or to buy food, or to survive. So I have to work. I have to do it. Jessica Cheung. All right. Well, thank you so much. Raul Giansante. OK. You are very welcome. Jessica Cheung. I really appreciate this. Raul Giansante. You are very welcome. And this is going to go on the radio?. Jessica Cheung. Yes. We are on the radio. We are also on the phone, like a podcast. I can send you a link, and all you have to do is press play. Raul Giansante. OK. Michael Barbaro. Well be right back. Archived Recording. Nightlife in New York City going dark. All bars across the city of New York will be closed. Many restaurants are now limited to take out and delivery services. Thousands of employees in New York City nightspots about to be out of work. Im thinking if we do this, itll open sooner. If we leave them open and everybody gets really sick, then everything gets closed for months. Daniel Guillemette. OK, it is March 16, and this is Daniel Guillemette. Im going to be going over to see Luca DiPietro. Hes a restaurant owner, owns five restaurants here in Manhattan. Hes going to be talking to staff about the shutdown. Thats why Im here now. Adriana. Hi, how are you?. Daniel Guillemette. Im here to see Mr. Luca. Adriana. Yes, hes not here. Come, lovely. Daniel Guillemette. OK. Adriana. Hes not here yet. Yes, come. Im Adriana. Daniel Guillemette. Very nice to meet you. Adriana. Yes, so sit. Daniel Guillemette. Ill just hang out. Luca Dipietro. Hi, guys. Daniel Guillemette. Hey, how are you doing?. Luca Dipietro. How are you? Im here to talk to my staff, and they already know restaurants have been ordered to shut down. But I just want to talk to them and give them the plan. Daniel Guillemette. How are you doing today, just yourself?. Luca Dipietro. Im very tired and very upset, but . Can I talk to you in private for a second?. Daniel Guillemette. Yeah, of course. Want me to turn it off?. Luca Dipietro. Yeah. Daniel Guillemette. OK. OK. Hes asked me to not be there as hes talking to his staff. So that conversation is happening right now. You can hear them applaud. Ill talk to him after. So do you mind telling me what you just spoke to your staff? This is, what, I guess maybe nine people or something?. Luca Dipietro. Yeah. I mean, what I told them I dont know if you could hear it, because I was just telling them that as of tonight, we have to close, and that Im really sorry that I couldnt keep it open. And I told them Im pushing very hard to get this delivery business up and running so that I can hopefully need help and get them back in and help out with packaging food and maybe taking orders, delivering. If we get busy, I would love for us to get busy so that I can bring people back in. Daniel Guillemette. Of course. So based on the staffers here tonight, youve got three cooks?. Luca Dipietro. Three cooks. Daniel Guillemette. In the back you got a busboy. Luca Dipietro. Yeah. Daniel Guillemette. A server, manager and a bartender?. Luca Dipietro. Yeah. Daniel Guillemette. So in this case, of these people here tonight, how many of them dont have a place right now?. Luca Dipietro. Not none of them. Theres no money. Theres no money to pay salaries. I love these guys are great. So the people that work here are amazing, and its a good group of people, and everybody understands, and everybody is shocked. I guess its a national crisis, but we dont see national. We see what is in front of us. And its tough, its very tough. And people are going to be suffering. And I dont know how much money is going to be available for people who lose their job. And nothing like this has ever happened. So I dont know what is in place. I just know that it pains me greatly to let people down. I know its not me, but thats how I feel. I think that Im used to relying on my own strengths, and possibly sometimes your strength is not enough. Speaker. Good, how are you?. Daniel Guillemette. Im good. Luca talked to you guys. How was it?. Akram Bouchette. I mean, we knew that it was coming, but I would say it all happened so fast. So we didnt really have time to prepare for that. Most of us are working on paycheck to paycheck. I have a little daughter and a wife. We married this location. We got married right here. Thats why its hard to see this place shutting down. So my name is Akram Bouchette. Ive been working for the company since 2012. So its eight years now, I would say. My wife also works in the business. She works in a different restaurant. So today they are officially closed. They basically fired everyone. So yeah, so the thing is both of us work in the same business and were not going to be making money for God knows how long. We have rent to pay, we have a child to take care of, we have insurance to pay and we have little savings. Were probably going to last for a month maybe. So yeah. Daniel Guillemette. Thank you, everybody, for the time. Adriana. Thank you, lovely. Daniel Guillemette. Thank you so much. Adriana. Good luck with everything. Daniel Guillemette. Yeah, you too. Andy Mills. This is Andy Mills. It is Monday night, and all the bars in New York City have been told that they have to close at 8:00 p.m. And so Ive come here to Sunnys Bar in Red Hook, Brooklyn, my favorite bar maybe in the entire world. It is at the edge of Brooklyn, right on the waterway. You can see the Statue of Liberty off in the distance. Im going to go spend the last minutes of being able to be at a bar in New York City with whoever is inside. Andy Mills. Just tell me your name and what youre doing here tonight. Henrich. My name is Henrich. So I was actually going to go to IKEA to get like some stuff, even though Im trying to be like smart about it, not go outside. But I was like, all right, I just want some stuff from IKEA. I get there, I get to IKEA, and this dude comes out and hes like, its closed. They shut it down. Its closed. And I was like, what do you mean? Its like 5:00 p.m. And he was like, no, its closed. So I was like, OK, wow, this is really happening. Like, IKEA got shut down. So I was like, all right, might as well just like go to Sunnys, you know, this bar were at right now, which is like my favorite bar. Because theyre closing it down tonight at like 8:00, I believe. So this is like my last chance like get out and be free before Im going to be inside for I dont know how long, I guess. Now were just going to go home. Like, weve stocked up on food. So I think were going to be good for a while. Andy Mills. Are you here for just one last round before they close?. Speaker. We realized we were in the neighborhood, and then we were like, oh, Sunnys is probably still open. Like, this the last half hour. Weve got to do something. We looked at the clock. We were like, oh my God, theres a half hour left. Weve got to get the last beer. Yeah, weve got to have the last drink here. This is going to be our last drink for like the next four to eight weeks, if not more. Like, it has to be Sunnys, right? Im going to probably keep drinking at home. Andy Mills. Let me ask you this. What are you going to miss from being out at a bar? Whats the difference?. Speaker. Oh, of course just bumping into a friend, or meeting a new person, seeing the classic bartender, everything that a bar has to offer, you know? Youre outside of your house, which is good if you live in a tiny like shoebox apartment that a lot of us do. Yeah. Im going to have a little glass of wine, just like a small one. Yeah, a little small one. Andy Mills. Can you just tell me your name and where were at right now?. Tone Johansen. My name is Tone Johansen and Im at Sunnys bar. Andy Mills. And what do you do here at Sunnys bar?. Tone Johansen. Well, I run this fine establishment well, I should say own this fine establishment. Andy Mills. You do. You own it, and you run it. You run it well. Tone Johansen. Thank you. Andy Mills. How are you feeling? What are you thinking right now?. Tone Johansen. Well, Ive been through a crisis or two before, and theres one thing to fight the new boogeyman, which is this virus. Another to cope with the fear that it instills in all of us. And what I try to concentrate on is how to care of your emotional health, because the fear is the alarm clock that wakes us up into action. But if we keep that alarm clock ringing, it will just drive us crazy, and then we cant take care of business. This will pass. Believe it or not, it will pass. Im Norwegian, and there is a Norwegian proverb that a love that goes like this either it will go well or it will pass, and those are two good options. And we will get through this, and especially New Yorkers, we will get through this, because were a hardy bunch. We just buckle down and get through stuff. Andy Mills. I guess weve got to close this place down, huh?. Tone Johansen. Well, I think weve got about 15 minutes, in which I will enjoy my little glass of wine. Andy Mills. All right. Cheers. Tone Johansen. All right. Cheers. Andy Mills. Well, its just a couple of minutes after 8:00. The music has been turned off. The patrons have been asked to go home. And its just me and the bartender and the owner speaking in Norwegian to her Norwegian friends, who are now putting on their coats, heading out. Andy Mills. Tone, now that the bars closed and emptied, how are you feeling about the financial aspect of being closed for a week, two weeks, three weeks, a month, maybe two months?. Tone Johansen. I do have to say that the finances right now are stressing me out more than the virus. Its like, I feel like we have a plan in place for how to try to prevent the spread of the virus, but we need a financial plan, and thats my main worry right now. Its a big uncertainty. Andy Mills. When you look out at all the other businesses in New York, from restaurants to taxi drivers, how common do you think that feeling that youre having is?. Tone Johansen. I think its in everybodys heart. You know, New York City, its a place where people hustle. I think every New Yorker is a hustler. Unless you were just born into money, you know how to hustle. Otherwise you just go back home again. But that being said, we also know how to get through a crisis. And weve been tested before, and this is a test. Well take it day by day. If you feel like you are paralyzed and cant do something about the situation youre in, if you cant take that first step, try to lift the foot. And if you cant lift your foot, try to wiggle your toe, and well get through it. Andy Mills. Tone, thank you for talking with me. Tone Johansen. And you too. And thank you for stopping by, and thank you for caring. Michael Barbaro. Well be right back. Heres what else you need today, Italy passed a grim milestone on Thursday, announcing that deaths from the coronavirus have reached 3,400, surpassing the toll in China, where the pandemic began. At the same time, China announced a very different milestone, reporting no new local infections for the first time, a sign that it has turned a corner in containing the disease. In the United States, the number of infections approached 12,000. California ordered all residents to remain in their homes. And the economic cost of the pandemic was revealed in new government data. Unemployment claims rose by 70,000 in the past week, an unusually rapid surge as the businesses shut down over the virus began laying off workers. The Times reports that the stimulus package under negotiation in Congress to try to revive the economy would send payments of $1,200 to individuals and $2,400 to families, but would be phased out for wealthier Americans. That legislation, expected to cost $1 trillion, is likely to be passed in the coming days.

Dr. Fauci, as was explained yesterday, there has been some promise with hydroxychloroquine, this potential therapy for people who are infected with coronavirus. Is there any evidence to suggest that as with malaria it might be used as a prophylaxis against Covid-19? No, the answer is no. And the evidence that youre talking about, John, is anecdotal evidence. So as the commissioner of F.D.A. and the president mentioned yesterday, were trying to strike a balance between making something with the potential of an effect to the American people available at the same time that we do it under the auspices of a protocol that would give us information to determine if its truly safe and truly effective. But the information that youre referring to specifically is anecdotal. It was not done in a controlled clinical trial. So you really cant make any definitive statement about it. We all understand what the doctor said is 100% correct. Its early, but weve, you know, Ive seen things that are impressive. Well see. Were going to know soon. Look it may work and it may not work. And I agree with the doctor, what he said. May work, may not work. I feel good about it. Its all it is, just a feeling. Im, you know, a smart guy. I feel good about it.

A charter flight carrying more than 230 Americans and more than 75 Canadians who had been evacuated from the Costa Luminosa cruise ship in France on Friday because health officials learned that three of the evacuees had tested positive for the coronavirus. According to two people who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the episode, the test results became known during the flight, triggering the hourslong delay that frustrated, angered and frightened those on the plane. Everyone is up in arms, Kelea Edgar Nevis,47, said in a text message from the stuck plane. Were going to have a mutiny. The return trip itself had been a harrowing all-night odyssey, with busloads of the passengers stuck for hours in Marseille before boarding the flight to Atlanta. Left without food for more than 24 hours, they started fainting on the plane. Several had severe coughs. Jennifer Catron, an evacuee who described herself as a wedding photographer with some medical experience, described a chaotic, dramatic flight with perhaps two dozen medical issues, some emergencies, some relatively minor. This plane is a medical disaster, Ms. Catron said in an email during the flight. The French media reported that more than 600 passengers disembarked on Thursday, of whom 75 were tested and 36 found positive for the virus, none of them French. The French passengers were bused home, and the handful of Spanish passengers were taken to a flight for Barcelona, the report said, while many American and Canadian passengers were taken to the Atlanta-bound flight. Italian passengers remained on the ship for a final leg of the voyage to their country. Scores of the evacuees on the flight to Atlanta also booked onward flights to their home cities, despite having been near sick people all night and on the cruise since at least March 5.

Haiti announced a state of emergency on Thursday after two patients were confirmed to have the coronavirus. Both patients were being treated in the University Hospital of Mirebalais, in the countrys central plateau. Both had been out of the country recently. In a televised news conference on Thursday evening, President Jovenel Moise , that meetings of more than 10 people were forbidden and a nightly curfew for the Caribbeans most densely populated country. If extreme precautions are not taken, the virus could quickly overwhelm the country, warned Elizabeth Campa, senior health and policy adviser for Zanmi Lasante, the Haitian nonprofit organization that runs the Mirebalais hospital in partnership with the government. The poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti has only 124 intensive care unit beds for a population of about 11 million, and the capability to mechanically ventilate fewer than 70 patients, according to a of hospitals done by the Research and Education consortium for the Acute Care in Haiti study group. But given that 75 percent of the population live in , on less than $2.50 a day and without access to electricity or clean water, it is hard to imagine how many could survive the containment measures being carried out in places like France and Italy.

Mr. Trump signaled Friday that the federal government was mobilizing industry to provide urgently needed resources to help halt the spread of the virus, but he did not specify what steps he had taken after days of conflicting messages about his intentions. On Friday, he said without evidence that he was using the Defense Production Act to help acquire millions of masks. The states are having a hard time getting them, Mr. Trump said at a news conference at the White House. We are using the act for things like this. If Mr. Trumps pledge comes to pass, after weeks of promises that failed to materialize, the supplies could relieve the strain on state and local governments. But at times, the president seemed to suggest that private industry was already stepping up, without being compelled by the government. We are literally being besieged in a beautiful way by companies that want to do the work and help our country, Mr. Trump said. We have not had a problem with that at all. The White House did not immediately respond to inquiries asking for examples of companies or industries that have been compelled under the law to spur production, as Mr. Trump claimed.

Some of the presidents advisers have privately said they share conservatives longstanding opposition of government intervention and oppose using the law, and the president again suggested his own ambivalence toward using it. At the same time, the president has faced increasing pressure from government officials and the health care industry to find a way to speed up new supplies. Before Mr. Trumps appearance on Friday, New York Citys mayor warned that the city was within weeks of running out of crucial supplies, with doctors and nurses confronting dwindling stocks of protective gear and hospitals facing shortages of lifesaving ventilators. And medical leaders in Washington State, which has the highest number of coronavirus deaths in the country, have begun to determine which patients may have to be denied complete medical care in the event that the health system becomes overwhelmed in the coming weeks. There have now been deaths in more than half the states, with the most in Washington State, New York and California. TERRIBLE CHOICES. Who gets care ?. The nations blood supply faces a dire shortage.

The American Red Cross normally supplies about 40 percent of the nations blood, but more than 4,500 of its blood drives had been canceled, resulting in nearly 150,000 fewer donations. Typically, the Red Cross needs to receive 13,000 blood donations daily, so it has Red blood cells are viable for 42 days, platelets for only five, so new donations are essential. Its an unprecedented situation, said Dr. Pampee Young, chief medical officer of biomedical services at the Red Cross. We are already actively triaging units, determining which hospitals can and cant get blood. While donor blood is not being used to treat coronavirus patients, transfusions are still needed for cases such as trauma, organ transplants or complications of childbirth. The worst case scenario could be a bleeding young patient who was in a car accident, and theres no blood, said Dr. Young. Were not quite there yet, but that is the ultimate fear.

French officials continued to tighten restrictions on movements ahead of the expected peak of the epidemic there. In Germany, authorities in the southern state of Bavaria issued an order asking people to stay indoors in most cases the most far-reaching measure in the country, which had been appealing to peoples sense of public duty and reason to keep them at home. And Britain, which had resisted the kind of wide scale closures that many other nations adopted days ago, reluctantly agreed to shutter one of the symbols of the nation: the pub. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the countrys cafes, pubs and restaurants to close Friday night, along with nightclubs, theaters, gyms, movie theaters and sports and leisure facilities. The measures will apply throughout the United Kingdom, after agreements were reached with the authorities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We have a real threat to our country and to the ability of our National Health Service to manage it, said Mr. Johnson, who added that he would keep the transportation network open. His announcement came as the chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, said that the government would help pay a big part of the wages of those unable to work. Up to 80 percent of the pay of those workers could be covered, said Mr. Sunak, who added that welfare provision would increase. The fast spread of the virus means that many nations are facing simultaneous shortages of desperately needed medical equipment from protective garb to beds to ambulances as their health care systems buckle under ever higher caseloads.

Were no longer in a phase of health alert, but instead of alarm. In the Catalonia region, hospital patients are being housed in hotels. Some hospitals in the Basque region have now dedicated most floors to coronavirus cases. And in France, there is a growing outcry over the scarcity of face masks. Jerome Salomon, a top official at Frances health ministry, said that 35 million had already been distributed and promised that authorities were ramping up production and distribution. Health officials in Germany, which has 28,000 intensive care beds, are attempting to increase capacity by setting up temporary hospitals in empty rehabilitation clinics, hotels and trade fair halls. After the onset of spring filled Bavarias parks and beer gardens with people sitting closely together, the state issued new rules prohibiting people from leaving home except for reasons including grocery shopping, caring for a relative or taking a walk and only alone or with family members.

The White House signaled Saturday that American companies were increasing efforts to restock hospitals with crucial supplies during the coronavirus pandemic, but it again stopped short of more assertive steps that some state and local leaders have been demanding. At a news conference on Saturday at the White House, Vice President Mike Pence said the federal government had ordered hundreds of millions of N-95 masks for health care facilities across the country, but he did not say precisely when they would be delivered to workers. And President Trump said another company, Hanes, was now on the roster of major corporations coordinating with the administration.

Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, in Mr. McConnells office Sunday morning, according to a person familiar with the plans. STIMULUS BATTLE. Economic rescue measures have sparked .

In on Saturday, the chief executives of major airlines, UPS and FedEx said that they would postpone mass layoffs and stock buybacks and dividends if Congress secured a large enough bailout for their industry. We are united as an industry and speaking with one voice, wrote the group, which included the heads of Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines. We urge you to swiftly pass a bipartisan bill with worker payroll protections to ensure that we can save the jobs of our 750,000 airline professionals. If Congress approves at least $29 billion in grants for the industry, the executives said they would commit to no furloughs or layoffs through August. If an equal amount in loans is passed, they would commit to limits on executive compensation and to freezing stock buybacks and dividends for the life of the loan. In a separate letter to senators on Saturday, Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants union, echoed the call for grants tied to employment, criticizing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells plan to provide the industry with loans. Federal aid designed for payroll is the only way to prevent massive layoffs, she said. Loans wont cut it. Ms. Nelson also said that such aid should be tied to limits on buybacks, executive pay and dividends, as well as protecting union contracts. TRAPPED WORKERS .

Italy has imposed a lockdown, deployed the army and risked its economy to try to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Yet Italys toll is growing more staggering by the day: On Saturday, officials reported 793 additional deaths, by far the largest single-day increase so far. Italy has surpassed China as the country with the highest death toll, becoming the epicenter of a shifting global pandemic. said on Saturday that all Italian businesses must close until April 3, with the exception of those essential to maintaining the countrys supply chain, Reuters reported. Supermarkets, pharmacies, postal and banking services will remain open, and essential public services including transport will be ensured, Mr. Conte said. It is the most difficult crisis in our postwar period, Mr. Conte said in a video posted on Facebook. The government is expected to publish an emergency decree on Sunday to make the latest crackdown immediately effective. Italy, Pandemics New Epicenter, Has Lessons for the World. March 21, 2020. The viruss effects are being felt throughout Europe. Poland has reported fewer than 500 cases, but one of the countrys hospitals was shut down and evacuated on Saturday after 30 patients and staff members were found to have the virus. France, one of the hardest hit countries in Europe, raised its totals to 14,459 confirmed cases and 562 deaths, and said it had ordered over 250 million face masks from French and foreign suppliers. The governor of the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg asked hospitals in his state to estimate capacity in their intensive care units, so that French patients in need of respirators from the heavily hit Alsace region can be transferred for treatment. The German authorities banned people in Berlin from meeting in groups of more than 10 people, with the exception of lawmakers, courts and those providing essential services, and Spains health ministry reported a surge in the number of coronavirus deaths to 1,326 and total cases to 25,000, a rise of about 25 percent from a day earlier. In the Madrid region, which has had 60 percent of Spains cases, hospitals are overflowing and facing equipment shortages. Officials ordered that a field hospital with about 5,500 beds be set up in the Spanish capitals main exhibition center. In the Valencia region, three field hospitals have been added, with a combined 1,000 beds. Hotels have also been converted into hospitals in Madrid and Catalonia, where 122 people have died. But Italys struggle is among the worlds most pronounced, and it is increasingly being seen as a tragic warning for other countries to heed, in part because it is still paying the price of early mixed messages by scientists and politicians. The people who have died in staggering numbers recently more than 2,300 in the last four days were mostly infected during the confusion of a week or two ago. FIGHTING THE VIRUS.

President Trump , Kim Jong-un, expressing his willingness to help the North battle the coronavirus, and North Korea responded by expressing gratitude. I would like to extend sincere gratitude to the U.S. president for sending his invariable faith to the Chairman, said Kim Yo-jong, the North Korean leaders sister and policy aide, in a statement carried by the Norths state-run Korean Central News Agency. Ms. Kim lauded Mr. Trumps decision to write the letter as a good judgment and proper action. In the letter, Mr. Trump wished the family of the Chairman and our people well-being, Ms. Kim said, referring to his brother by one of his official titles. According to Ms. Kim, Mr. Trump also explained his plan to move relations between the two countries forward and expressed his intent to render cooperation in the anti-epidemic work, saying that he was impressed by the efforts made by the Chairman to defend his people from the serious threat of the epidemic. The White House confirmed that Mr. Trump had sent Mr. Kim a letter but did not comment on its specifics. Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim have repeatedly touted their unusual relationship. But relations between Pyongyang and Washington have cooled since the leaders second summit meeting, held in Vietnam in February of last year, over differences regarding how quickly North Korea should dismantle its nuclear weapons program and when Washington should ease sanctions. Mexico is allowing Central American migrants to be returned to Mexico. The border of Mexico and the United States.Credit...Guillermo Arias/Agence France-Presse Getty Images. The Mexican government is allowing the United States to immediately return Central American migrants who cross the southwestern border illegally as part of . The United States will begin immediately returning some migrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to Mexico, according to a Customs and Border Protection official and an official with the Mexican government. The Trump administration has said to combat a potential outbreak of the coronavirus in border facilities. Mexico, in an about-face, confirmed that some Central Americans would be returned to Mexico. Officials at the Foreign Relations Ministry did not respond to requests for comment on the specifics of the plan. As recently as Friday, Marcelo Ebrard, the foreign minister for Mexico, said his country would only accept Mexicans who were rapidly returned. Central American migrants were sent to Mexico from the United States under a different policy that allows them to make an asylum claim but forces them to wait south of the border as their cases wind through the U.S. immigration system. Under the new rule, migrants found to have a criminal history or unaccompanied children will not be immediately returned. But Central Americans and Mexicans will be driven to the nearest port of entry and rushed back to Mexico. Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of homeland security, said other border crossers would be flown back to their home country. It remains unclear whether the directive from the top health officials in the United States would prevent every migrant from having an opportunity to claim asylum. Immigration lawyers have said the rule potentially violates laws that say the United States must provide a migrant on American soil the opportunity to ask for protections and not force migrants to return to places where they would face persecution. BORDER CONTROL. New York is declared a major disaster area. 0:00/7:29. Everything Is Uncharted: New Yorkers Confront Life Amid a Coronavirus Shutdown. With restrictions tightened on businesses and daily activity, residents are grappling with uncertainty about resources, health care and their paychecks. Were going to put out an executive order today. New York State on pause only essential businesses will be functioning. 100% of the workforce must stay home. This is the most drastic action we can take. Everything is uncharted territory. Nobody knows whats going to happen in the news any minute. I think Ive been asking a lot of how we could have prevented this. Am I going to see another depression like my grandfather saw in the 1920s? Over the past few days, New York City has taken a lot of important measures. Im just worried it came a little bit too late. I think Im scared of having to see more death and from reading stories from abroad, having to make decisions about resources. And Im worried people in my life are going to die from it. A few days ago, I had to watch a patient basically slowly die. I just felt helpless. This is the first time Ive really seen people that I truly dont know how to help. And they are coming in so sick that everything Im used to doing to be able to treat them, I cant really do. How was your day off, Mich? It was emotional, to say the least. Why? Its just, like, the hospital has been insane. And every hour, like, things are changing. So its just, like, trying to keep up with that while trying to read about what I should be treating these people with, while people are rolling in the worst I dont know. They say in 18 days its supposed to get really bad. I guarantee you tomorrow were going to have like 1,000 more. The numbers are going to go up. Thats no problem at all. Thank you very much. Thats very nice. Thank you. Sounds good. See you then. Bye. Well, I have been working. A lot of people are not, which is hard. This place used to have 30 employees, and on Sunday we let go of 90% of the staff. We want to reopen so we can rehire people, you know? It was really hard to let everyone go. These are people that are at the level, theyre not wealthy, you know? This is a very harsh reality. And actually what the job is, is smiling through stress. And this is hard to smile through.  Its go time here at the community kitchen. This is the time where we have to ramp up our services to be very sensitive to how people are feeling. People are coming to us feeling vulnerable. They maybe work in the restaurant industry. People who work in Broadway and in a lot of the behind-the-scenes, theyre coming here saying, well, I dont have work. So those industries are the folks that are the first ones that were seeing come through. But were preparing to see more people come through in need. All programming at the senior center is suspended for the next two weeks. Stay safe and have a good day. So this is not business as usual. We dont know whats coming up if people have to stay in their homes for a longer period of time. And we want to make sure people are getting food, especially since a lot of industries are out of work. We are expecting a lot of new people, and we are going to be ready to receive them. This is all very new for them, and some of them are feeling guilt or shame coming to an emergency food program. So we have to remember that we do this all the time, but for them, its something new and something that they feel anxious about doing. Were just getting them registered. Theyre getting food. Thats our main priority is people are getting food.  Im not supposed to touch my face. Hold on a second. I have prepared myself already, mentally, multiple times, to go back to Oregon and leave this entire beautiful dream behind me. So many people, including many of my friends, are working at bars, at restaurants, which are now closed. And now were all at home, wondering, Can we make it another month? Can our families afford to pay their mortgages at home? Do we just need to go back and start working, just so we can help our own families, the people that we love the most, stay in the homes that we grew up in? Its hard to think that my mom or my dad are never going to see retirement. The best things that we can do right now as a community is just to give ourselves over to something that brings us true happiness. Because right now, it feels like its about to get very desperate. This is only something that we can get through if were working together. There will be so much suffering, unnecessary suffering, if were not really looking out for each other and if we only think about ourselves and our well-being. We have to be thinking about each other. 00:00. 7:29. 7:29Everything Is Uncharted: New Yorkers Confront Life Amid a Coronavirus Shutdown.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency issued a Major Disaster Declaration for New York, meaning billions of dollars in federal aid could be coming to New York as the rising number of coronavirus cases shows no sign of abating. As of Saturday, 10,356 New York state residents had tested positive for the virus. With 6 percent of the U.S. population, the state now accounts for nearly half of the cases in the country. Stay-at-home orders in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are set to go into effect over the next couple days. New Jerseys takes effect at 9 p.m. Saturday, New Yorks at 8 p.m. on Sunday and Connecticut on Monday at 8 p.m. Non-essential businesses are ordered closed and residents are being asked to remain indoors unless exercising or shopping for food or medicine. On Friday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said that one million N-95 protective masks were being sent to hospitals in New York City and another 500,000 to Long Island. The state had also identified about 6,000 ventilators from places all across the globe for purchase, the governor said. With coronavirus threatening, state officials are considering turning landmark locations like the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center into makeshift hospitals. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is also looking at other locations, including two at State University of New York campuses on Long Island, and at the Westchester Convention Center. The Army Corps is expected to outfit the centers with hospital equipment as soon as Mr. Cuomo tours and green lights the locations, officials said.

For more than a week, the 315 passengers aboard the Silver Shadow cruise liner were stuck in their cabins in Recife, Brazil, after a Canadian passenger fell ill and ultimately tested positive for the coronavirus. Late Saturday, the State Department said the United States Embassy in Brazil and the Consulate General in Recife to return the American passengers on the ship on a special charter flight. The passengers received meals in their rooms and had their temperatures checked daily. No one else has gotten sick. Over the past few days, most of the 18 countries with citizens aboard the Silver Shadow have chartered aircraft and flown their residents home from Brazil. Canadian travelers left the ship on Saturday, but 103 Americans remain stranded and afloat. Ship personnel told the Americans they would be taken off the ship early Saturday and flown on a charter flight to Dallas, according to one American passenger. But that plan was canceled early Saturday without explanation. Luxembourg, Romania, Uruguay and even Italy have flown their citizens home, but not the United States, the American passenger said in a phone call from the ship, adding that Mr. Trumps America First mantra has become America Last. The passenger asked not to be identified out of fear of retribution from ship personnel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"22 March, 2020","As State Pleas Mount, Trump Outlines Some Federal Action; Senate Democrats Block Stimulus Package . New York State has 15,000 cases, roughly 5 percent of the pandemics growing global total. Senator Rand Paul tested positive for the coronavirus. Senator Chuck Schumer speaking to reporters at the Capitol on Sunday.Credit...Erin Scott for The New York Times. Senate Democrats block action on a trillion-dollar stimulus plan. Senate Democrats on Sunday on an emerging deal to prop up an economy devastated by the coronavirus pandemic, paralyzing the progress of a nearly $2 trillion government rescue package they said failed to adequately protect workers or impose strict enough restrictions on bailed-out businesses. The party-line vote was a stunning setback after three days of fast-paced negotiations between senators and administration officials to reach a bipartisan compromise on legislation that is expected to be the largest economic stimulus package in American history now expected to cost $1.8 trillion or more. In a 47-to-47 vote, the Senate fell short of the 60 votes that would have been needed to advance the measure, even as talks continued behind the scenes between Democrats and the White House to salvage a compromise. The failure to move forward shook financial markets and threatened an ambitious timeline set by the Trump administration and leading Republicans to move the rescue package through the Senate on Monday and enact it within days. In voting to block action, Democrats risked a political backlash if they are seen as obstructing progress on a measure that is widely regarded as crucial to aid desperate Americans and buttress a flagging economy. Unlock more free articles. This is irresponsible and unwise, said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. They are playing with fire. The move enraged Republicans, whose numbers were dwindling after Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, and prompted two senators to self-isolate and miss the vote that evening. The maneuver by Democrats, they argued, contravened days of bipartisan negotiations that continued in private and jeopardized faith that Congress was capable of mustering a legislative salve for a shuddering economy. The mood in the Capitol was grim as the vote unfolded, in an eerie echo of the spectacle in 2008 when the House initially defeated a $700 billion Wall Street bailout that aimed to stabilize the financial system amid a global meltdown, sending the Dow Jones industrials plunging. Sunday evenings vote was a procedural one, but it shook markets all the same. Dow futures fell 5 percent, triggering a limit down, meaning they could not fall any further. Senators and aides said they still hoped to reach a compromise on the legislation in the coming hours, with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, declaring after the vote that were closer than weve been at any time over the past 48 hours to an agreement.

Governors plead for masks and ventilators, and Trump outlines response. President Trump speaking to reporters at the White House on Sunday.Credit...Al Drago for The New York Times. After the governors of multiple states and other leaders made urgent pleas on Sunday for masks and other protective equipment to help fight the swelling outbreak, President Trump listed a number of federal actions in a news conference in the evening. As the number of known cases in the United States crossed 31,700, California officials told hospitals to restrict coronavirus testing, and a hospital in Washington State warned that it could run out of life-preserving ventilators by early next month. Washington States Department of Health told local leaders that only the highest-priority areas would have access to the governments reserves of protective equipment, including N95 masks. Mr. Trump said that major disaster declarations were in process for New York, California and Washington the three states hardest hit by the virus and that they would not have to pay for deploying National Guard units. Through FEMA, the federal government will be funding 100 percent of the cost of deploying National Guard units to carry out approved missions to stop the virus, while those governors remain in command, Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump placed National Guard units from California, New York and Washington under Title 32 authority. This means the troops from these states will still be under the control of their states governors but will be supporting a federal mission, much like the roughly 2,200 National Guard soldiers currently on the southern border. Gen. Joseph L. Lengyel, the head of the National Guard Bureau, told reporters Sunday that the troops will support the Department of Health and Human Services with testing and at medical facilities, as well as provide unspecified support for FEMA. Were in this for the long haul, General Lengyel said. Its a historic event and its going to require a historic response. Mr. Trump also said during the Sunday conference that he had directed FEMA to supply four large federal medical stations with 1,000 beds for New York, eight large federal medical stations with 2,000 beds for California, and three large federal medical stations and four small federal medical stations with 1,000 beds for the State of Washington. Updated 5m ago. More live coverage: . The stations for New York, to be built in Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, were announced earlier in the day by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. As Mr. Trump detailed federal activities, he at times repeated facts and appeared halting as he described a complex list of facts and figures in the millions. WHAT TO DO. If you or a loved one might have the coronavirus, . Many state and local officials have pressed Mr. Trump to use his authority under the to mobilize industry to manufacture scarce goods. On Sunday, Peter T. Gaynor, the FEMA administrator said the president was not doing so, and instead was using the threat of the act as leverage to demonstrate that we can. At the news conference on Sunday, Mr. Trump defended his decision not to implement the Defense Production Act despite an outcry from state governors and Democrats. Call a person over in Venezuela, Mr. Trump said. Ask them, how did nationalization of their businesses work out? Not too well. The concept of nationalizing our businesses is not a good concept. The presidents top trade adviser said that, in fact, the act had spurred the countrys industrial base to voluntarily mobilize, allowing for the quick conversion of corporate production facilities to produce medical supplies. Were getting what we need without putting the heavy hand of government down, Peter Navarro, the presidents top trade adviser, told reporters. MEDICAL RATIONING. .bout in hospitals.

A sharp increase in confirmed coronavirus cases in New York State on Sunday indicated that the state now accounts for . The jump stemmed from both the rapid growth of the outbreak and a significant increase in testing in the state. Health officials emphasized that testing was revealing how quickly the virus had spread. There are now 15,168 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the state, up 4,812 since Saturday, and 114 deaths, Mr. Cuomo said. About 13 percent, or 1,974 people in New York who tested positive for the virus, were hospitalized, he said. The governor took issue with what he called the insensitive and arrogant behavior of New York City residents who continued to gather in parks and other public spaces. Mr. Cuomo indicated that he would give the city 24 hours to come up with a plan to reduce density in these spaces, which he would need to approve. I dont know what Im saying that people dont get, Mr. Cuomo said, suggesting that city officials could close some streets to traffic to give residents more outdoor space. Appearing on NBCs Meet the Press on Sunday morning, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York warned that the citys hospitals were straining under a deluge of cases, and he again called on Mr. Trump to send more help. April is going to be worse than March, he said. And I fear May will be worse than April. N.Y. LATEST UPDATES. New York now has roughly . Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky tests positive for the virus.

Gee, thats too bad, Mr. Trump said dryly when he was apparently told for the first time by a reporter that Mr. Romney the lone Republican senator who voted to convict Mr. Trump during his impeachment trial last month had entered isolation on Sunday.

The Food and Drug Administration said Sunday that hospitals and health care professionals may now repurpose ventilators that were originally intended for other environments. For example, the agency said, hospitals could adapt ventilators that are now used in ambulances for use on patients who are being treated inside their facilities. In addition, the agency said that manufacturers that would normally need F.D.A. clearance to modify a ventilator could now do it without an agency review. The F.D.A. said that this would help companies speed up their manufacturing by obtaining ventilator parts from automobile manufacturers or other companies that do not currently make medical devices. We are providing maximum regulatory flexibility to facilitate an increase in ventilator inventory, while still providing crucial F.D.A. oversight, said Stephen Hahn, the agencys commissioner. Hospitals across the country have been that they cannot find anywhere to buy ventilators, which help patients breathe and can mean the difference between life and death for those struggling with the most dire respiratory effects of the coronavirus. American and European manufacturers say they cannot speed up production enough to meet the soaring demand, at least not soon. Canada says it wont participate in the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics.

Canadas Olympic and Paralympic Committees said Sunday night that the country will not send teams to the Tokyo Games unless they are postponed by a year. While we recognize the inherent complexities around a postponement, nothing is more important than the health and safety of our athletes and the world community, the groups said. This is not solely about athlete health it is about public health. The committees said that going ahead with the Olympics as planned in July contradicts advice from public health officials, and that training for the Games threatens the health of athletes.

The Mercy, the name of the ship stationed on the West Coast, will head to Los Angeles within the next week or so, while the Comfort, currently undergoing repairs in Virginia, will head to New York Harbor in three to four weeks, Mr. Trump said. Theyre incredible ships, he said. Theyre meant for war. Mr. Trump said maintenance on the Comfort had been accelerated and that staffing of both ships with proper medical personnel is underway. Both ships have space for up to a thousand hospital beds. On Wednesday, Air Force Brig. Gen.

Communities in warmer places appear to have , according to an early analysis by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The researchers found that most cases occurred in regions with low temperatures, between 37.4 and 62.6 degrees Fahrenheit . Wherever the temperatures were colder, the number of the cases started increasing quickly, said Qasim Bukhari, a computational scientist at M.I.T. who is a co-author of the study. You see this in Europe, even though the health care there is among the worlds best. The temperature dependency is also clear within the United States, Dr. Bukhari said. Arizona, Florida and Texas have seen slower outbreak growth compared with Washington, New York and Colorado. Coronavirus cases in California have grown at a rate that falls somewhere in between. Dr. Bukhari acknowledged that factors like travel restrictions, social distancing measures, variations in the availability of tests and hospital burdens might have affected the number of cases in different locations.

In Peru, Jessica Buie, 25, a student at Lenoir-Rhyne University in North Carolina, said she and her fellow students packed their bags and headed to the U.S. Consulate in Cusco as soon as they got word that the Peruvian government would close its border. They found a note on the Consulate gate advising U.S. citizens to call airlines, and providing a number to the American Embassy in Lima, which turned out to be incorrect. I felt a little helpless, Ms. Buie said on Saturday, as she and her fellow students remained in Peru. I felt we were going to have to work together as a group, to be a wolf pack at this time to get ourselves out. She is among 17 students and faculty from four colleges in Georgia, Alabama and North Carolina who are still in Cusco and Lima. A half-dozen physical therapy students from the University of North Carolina are stuck in Guatemala. And about 2,000 Americans enrolled in State Department-funded educational and cultural exchange programs worldwide remain in their host countries, the department said Saturday. U.S. government efforts to evacuate Americans have been halting. President Trump said this past week that the military would bring back Americans from Peru, though evacuations had not taken place as of Saturday even as that country imposed further restrictions on charter flights.

And immediately, in the next two, three hours we see 10, 8, 9 patients exactly with the same clinical presentation. Every single square meter is occupied by beds, every single aisle is filled up by beds. And you can hardly recognize where you normally work. The gastroenterology ward is not there anymore. Internal medicine is not there. Neurology has been replaced. Doctors from other specialties have been called to do shifts. We had seven I.C.U. beds and now we have 24. As many as 5 to 10 percent of the severe cases and of deaths are actually among the health care personnel. We forget to eat, we forget to drink, and we keep on working. Im far away from my family since Feb. 19. The worst is somebody dying in the isolated ward asking for the wife, the husband for the last hours of their life and having no chance to have anybody around and dying on their own. So the problem is that now we dont have any intensive care beds anymore. We have to intubate, put on a helicopter and transfer to another region, actually, because in the region all the intensive cares are full. Prepare more intensive care beds, get more devices for mechanical ventilation. Do the swab to everybody within the hospital and be aware that somebody will not make it anyway. We try to give our best to win not only the battle, but win the war, finally. 00:00. 4:39. 4:39Brace Yourself: How Doctors in Italy Responded to Coronavirus.

In Spain, some 3,500 doctors and other health workers have tested positive for the coronavirus, accounting for roughly 12 percent of the countrys cases, the Spanish health ministry said on Sunday. The number of dead in Spain rose by about 400 overnight to reach 1,753 on Sunday. reported 3,957 new cases on Sunday, and the countrys total reached 59,138. There were also 651 deaths, with the total reaching 5,476. But the increases in both numbers were lower than reported a day earlier, and officials hoped that the lockdowns and other restrictive measures were working. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis of Greece on Sunday announced a ban on all unnecessary movement by citizens across the country.

A 15-year-old was reported to be in critical condition and others were injured, news outlets reported. It was the strongest earthquake to hit the city since 1880. Croatia has 235 cases. Uzbekistan, which has reported 42 cases, said the countrys borders with Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and Tajikistan would be closed to everyone except foreign citizens leaving the country and international cargo haulers. From Wednesday, anyone not wearing a mask in a public place will be fined. In Iran, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected a reported offer of U.S. assistance, citing an unfounded conspiracy theory that the virus was created by America. The country has more than 21,000 cases. Cases in the Czech Republic rose to 1,047, Health Ministry data showed, and 15,584 people had been tested as of Saturday. Belgium is heading into the peak of the epidemic, after which the curve will go down, the countrys health minister, Maggie de Bock, said on Twitter.

The party may be an example of the kind of thing we call a super-spreading event, said William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard, especially since some of the partygoers later attended large social events in the New York metropolitan area, where cases of the virus are high. Worry, rumors and recriminations engulfed the town. Political leaders fielded hundreds of emails and phone calls from residents terrified that their children or vulnerable family members had been exposed. Who threw the party, and who attended? They wanted to know. Rumors flew that some residents were telling health officials they had attended the party so they could obtain a scarce test. As the disease spread, many residents kept mum, worried about being ostracized by their neighbors and that their children would be kicked off coveted sports teams or miss school events.

There is collective anxiety surrounding Covid-19, but theres also collective loss. Here are some ways to help navigate through our losses. 1. Acknowledge the grief. Although anxiety is unpleasant, it can be easier to acknowledge anxiety than to acknowledge grief. Thats because there are two kinds of anxiety: productive anxiety and unproductive anxiety. Grieving, on the other hand, is a much quieter process. It requires us to sit with our pain, to feel a kind of sadness that makes many of us so uncomfortable that we try to get rid of it. In the age of coronavirus, a child might say: Im so sad that Im missing seeing my friends every day and the parent, trying to lessen the childs pain, might say: But honey, were so lucky that were not sick and youll get to see your friends soon! A more helpful response might be: I know how sad you are about this. You miss being with your friends so much. Its a big loss not to have that. Just as our kids need to have their grief acknowledged, we need to acknowledge our own. The more we can say to ourselves and the people around us, Yes, these are meaningful losses, the more seen and soothed we will feel. 2. Stay in the present. Theres a term to describe the kind of loss many of us are experiencing: . In ambiguous grief, theres a murkiness to the loss. With Covid-19, on top of the tangible losses, theres the uncertainty about how long this will last and what will happen next that leaves us mourning our current losses as well as ones we havent experienced yet. Ambiguous grief can leave us in a state of ongoing mourning, so its important for us to stay grounded in the present. Instead of futurizing or catastrophizing ruminating about losses that havent actually happened yet  we can focus on the present by adopting a concept I call Both/and means that we can feel loss in the present and also feel safe exactly where we are snuggled up with a good book, eating lunch with our kids who are home from school, taking a walk with a family member, and even celebrating a birthday via FaceTime. We may have lost our sense of normalcy, but we can still stay present for the ordinary right in front of us. 3. Let people experience loss in their own way. Although loss is universal, the ways in which we grieve are deeply personal. For some, the loss of stability leads to a reckoning with mortality, while for others, it leads to a rehaul of ones closet or stress-baking. In other words, theres no one-size-fits-all for grief. Even Elisabeth Kubler-Rosss familiar stages of grieving denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance arent meant to be linear. Everyone moves through loss in a unique way, so its important to let people do their grieving in whatever way works for them without diminishing their losses or pressuring them to grieve the way you are. A good rule of thumb: you do you . is a therapist and the author of Maybe You Should Talk to Someone. READ MORE. March 23, 2020, 8:15 p.m. ETMarch 23, 2020. March 23, 2020, 8:15 p.m. ET. By . A screenshot from a video shows the interaction between Pam Triolo, the mayor of Lake Worth Beach, and a city commissioner, Omari Hardy.Credit...Screenshot from YouTube. HOLLYWOOD, Fla. The mayor of Lake Worth Beach, Fla., and a city commissioner had an exchange last week, captured in a two-minute-and-17-second , that provided a glimpse into the high-stakes tension facing local government officials across the country amid the coronavirus outbreak. Debates over shutdowns and containment measures and their economic impact are boiling over as stakes rise. The city commissioner, Omari Hardy, had watched the news as the coronavirus transformed from a distant outbreak to a threat to local lives. Mr. Hardy thought the city of about 38,000, which stretches seven square miles not far from President Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort, needed to act quickly to blunt the spread of the coronavirus and to protect the citys most vulnerable. He wanted officials to immediately ban large public gatherings, stop shutting off delinquent electric and water accounts, establish more protections for city workers and find out who had lawful emergency powers. Mr. Hardy said that he had tried to arrange a special commission meeting for a week as cases in Florida multiplied, but that at every turn, his requests were dismissed by the city manager, Michael Bornstein, who at one point told him to calm down. So by the time the five-member commission met on Thursday, Mr. Hardy was seething. And it would not be long before everybody knew it. At the end of a fraught two-hour meeting, Mr. Hardy unleashed his exasperation on Mayor Pam Triolo and Mr. Bornstein in a fiery speech that would be alternatively characterized on social media as heroic and disrespectful after it was by The Palm Beach Post. This is a banana republic is what youre turning this place into with your so-called leadership, Mr. Hardy shouted at Ms. Triolo in the meeting, his voice booming. We should have been talking about this last week. We cut off peoples utilities this week and made them pay what could have been their last check to us to turn their lights on in a global health pandemic. But you dont care about that. You didnt want to meet. Ms. Triolo did not sit idly by. She repeatedly slammed the gavel to recess the meeting and quiet Mr. Hardy. And she yelled right back at him. Ms. Triolo, in her fourth term as mayor, suggested that Mr. Hardys rant was intentional grandstanding for attention he is running for a Florida State House seat. Mr. Bornstein acknowledged that service to dozens of residents had been suspended earlier, but he said no utility disconnections had taken place since a moratorium was announced on Wednesday, the day before the explosive meeting. Those customers had already had their service restored, he said, and fines had been reversed. READ MORE. March 23, 2020, 8:00 p.m. ETMarch 23, 2020. March 23, 2020, 8:00 p.m. ET. By and .

But it has left many of them struggling to stay solvent. Alternative weeklies and daily papers in small and midsize cities across the United States were already suffering because of the recession last decade, the migration of readers from print to online and the decline of the advertising business. Since 2004, roughly one-fourth of American newspapers more than 2,000 have been lost to mergers or shutdowns, according to researchers at the University of North Carolina. Most were weeklies. The arrival of the coronavirus shook the industrys already weakened economic foundation. As ad revenue and the money generated by events sponsored by small publications started to evaporate, many papers have canceled print editions, laid off workers or asked readers for donations. Among those affected: , a magazine about gay issues in Washington, D.C.; , a soccer publication in New York; and , a gambling newspaper in Las Vegas. One of the big problems with all of this is you dont know when this is going to end, said Doyle Murphy, the editor in chief of Riverfront Times.

Her name was Loretta, but they called her Lettie. She stood 4 feet 10 inches tall. She was outrageously friendly, the kind of person liable to invite the sales clerk at T-Mobile to join the family for dinner. This made her children cringe but was also something they loved. Pure Lettie. She was tough. At work, she could stare down colleagues who were hairy, blustery and taller than her by a foot or two. And it was true of her husband, Roddy. He could not say no to her. Roddy had not wanted to go on their February trip to the Philippines. He was watching the early news about the coronavirus, and worried it would put his wife, a cancer survivor, in danger. But she was adamant. There was something she needed to finish. On March 11, Loretta Dionisio became a data point. In the ongoing tally of fatalities associated with the coronavirus, hers was the 37th death in the United States, the first in Los Angeles County. After she tested positive for the virus, the family was occupied with crisis management, five or six hours a day of phone calls to public health officials, the crematory, hospital staff. Not only their father, but also their aunt and uncle, and another aunt and cousin, have been ordered to self-quarantine. A memorial gathering, for now, is out of the question. We dont want to put any other family members in harms way, Ms. Dionisios son, Rembert, said. Thats what makes everything really rough right now.

The Federal Reserve on Monday resurrected an asset-purchase facility from the 2008 financial crisis intended to encourage banks and financiers to make loans to small businesses and households. It also plans to announce a new Main Street Business Lending Program designed to support lending to eligible small and medium-sized businesses but offered few details. A disaster loan program is already up and running. Congress for through the Small Business Administration. Unlike the agencys flagship loans, which are made by banks, disaster loans are issued directly by the government. But the main federal lifeline offered so far low-interest disaster loans is unappealing to many small business owners running on thin margins and leery of taking on debt they cant afford to repay as theyve been forced to close and lay off employees. All we do is make enough money to make it through the off-season, said Donna Benefiel, who owns the Sunset Produce Market in Banks, Ore., and a grocery store on the Oregon coast. Were not that profitable. We dont have any reserves. How do we borrow a years worth of money and then have to pay it back?. Borrowers who own their homes often risk losing the property if they cant repay what they borrowed. Terms like that spook business owners, especially now, when there is little clarity around when and how the coronavirus pandemic will subside, and whether mom-and-pop shops will ever recover. The Trump administration and lawmakers have discussed plans for , including direct payments to individuals and aid for battered industries like the airlines. A memo circulated on Wednesday by the Treasury Department proposed $300 billion for small business interruption loans. That would be a vastly larger program than anything the government has previously run. Last year, the Small Business Administration backed $28 billion in loans issued by banks; its disaster program lent out just over $2 billion. The agency is used to ramping up quickly to disburse loans after natural disasters like floods and earthquakes after Hurricane Harvey in 2017, it processed most loan applications in less than three weeks but its track record with large economic disasters is troubled. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Congress ordered the S.B.A. to partner with banks on zero-interest loans of up to $35,000 to viable small companies hurt by the recession. The program was laden with complex rules, and fewer than 9,000 companies took the loans. Nearly half of the applications approved , auditors estimated. And many vulnerable businesses cannot afford to wait weeks for a cash infusion. The median small company takes in $381 a day and spends $374, a 2016 by the JPMorgan Chase Institute found. The typical business has enough savings to survive just 27 days. READ MORE. March 23, 2020, 6:30 p.m. ETMarch 23, 2020. March 23, 2020, 6:30 p.m. ET. By . Khara Tapay Jabola-Carolus was recently at a Target in Honolulu and noticed an influx of crisis tourists, people whove traveled from the contiguous United States to Hawaii seeking more isolation amid the coronavirus pandemic. We have a weak social safety net and an economy overly dependent on tourism, she wrote to The New York Timess Dilemmas column. These outsiders could push us over the edge, especially because tourists are often prioritized at the expense of local residents. Its an instant national ethical dilemma, exacerbating already-tense relationships between rich and poor, urban and rural, and, in the case of Hawaii, largely white outsiders and more diverse locals. Who gets to shelter where? Or take the last sack of flour at a small supermarket?. Destinations known for welcoming visitors are now closing themselves off. After Ms. Jabola-Carolus wrote, Hawaii announced a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all incoming travelers.

But it will be hard to top the star of singing Simply the Best in a bathtub, clad in a bathing suit worthy of a 1970s Bond girl. At the end of the song, she whipped out a tiny toy saxophone. What made this surreal scene even more memorable was that by then a beaming Warren had already attempted the song twice, each time foiled by her audio feed. As a running gag, it was sheer perfection, and the obvious accidental nature just made it more endearing. This was not the only time technical difficulties hampered the online The Rosie ODonnell Show, in which the participants the vast majority of them from the Broadway or Broadway-adjacent community called in from their homes.

As hospitals around the United States brace for an ongoing surge in coronavirus cases, one question they are grappling with is whether medical students should be deployed to help care for patients infected with the virus. For now, the nations 90,000 medical students have been largely sidelined from patient care during the crisis. The reasoning is that sending medical students home helps conserve scarce personal protective equipment including masks, gloves and gowns. It also gives schools time to educate students on Covid-19 should the students eventually be needed for patient care. Disappointed by the abrupt halt to their training, medical students around the country have responded with grass-roots efforts to secure masks, staff patient call centers and even provide child care for beleaguered doctors. I thought Id be learning to listen to the heart and lungs or conduct an outpatient interview, but thats not what is needed right now, said Elyse Berlinberg, a second-year medical student at N.Y.U.

The Wilkinson family two parents and four teenage-to-20-something children all live in the same house in California. Theyre so close that, ordinarily, their idea of fun is to all pile onto Mom and Dads bed to watch The Bachelor. But in late January, Diana, a 56-year-old math teacher, learned she had a rare, aggressive form of endometrial cancer and a 50 percent chance of survival. Her husband and children have been told to keep their distance, because chemotherapy has left her vulnerable to infection. The family is especially jittery because one daughter recently returned from Italy after her study abroad program skidded to a halt. Another is a U.S. Marine who spends weekdays on a base where others have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Meagan Wilkerson has become the enforcer, telling her mother to separate herself. Mrs. Wilkinson feels hurt. Meagan feels guilty. So the Wilkinsons are living a more acute version of our collective dilemma: longing for connections they once took for granted, terrified of making mistakes and unsure how to get through the coming months.

To seek help for the Wilkinsons, and the rest of us, I turned to authorities on how to cope with : therapists who advise cancer patients and their families, including during treatments like stem-cell transplants, which can involve prolonged isolation and other measures to guard against infection. Ian Sadler, a psychologist at Columbia University Medical Center, gently dismissed Meagan Wilkinsons fear that she would damage her mother by not hugging her. Distancing can be an act of care, he said. A lack of embrace is now an embrace. Allison Applebaum, a psychologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, worried about the burden on the Wilkinson children. Maintaining complete distance and cleanliness, monitoring contact and food, is an enormous source of anxiety, she said, for them and now everyone else. You cant do it perfectly a hundred percent of the time. Note to everyone who is wiping, washing and Clorox-ing these days: in some cancer caregivers, the responsibility of constantly trying to eliminate germs contributes to post-traumatic stress symptoms, she said. To find a substitute for cuddling, Dr. Applebaum suggested an exercise she does with her patients. If a father longs to play ball outside with his son, she asks him: What was it about playing ball in the backyard that was meaningful? Was it about the ball, or was it connecting with him? The goal is to find an alternate activity that delivers similar satisfaction. Grace Ashford contributed research.

In what could prove to be a hot topic nationwide, groups representing people with disabilities on Monday challenged dealing with the coronavirus in the event that they do not have enough lifesaving resources for all the patients who need them. The triage care plan could result in end-of-life decisions that disadvantage those with disabilities, said David Carlson, the director of advocacy at Disability Rights Washington. The groups complaint calls for the federal government to quickly intervene to investigate, issue findings and make sure that doctors and hospitals do not discriminate against people with disabilities when making treatment decisions. Washingtons rationing scheme places the lives of disabled people at serious risk, the advocacy groups wrote in the complaint to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights. The complaint in Washington State was the first to be filed, but advocates for the disabled said they expect to scrutinize similar triage plans around the country to see if they provide equal access to lifesaving care to people with disabilities. The federal government has a very brief moment to intercede, the complaint said. If it does not, it said, there will be no way to undo the lethal outcome of the discriminatory plans that have been formulated without O.C.R.s guidance. READ MORE.

They form a small army, some 35,000 residential doormen, concierges, porters, handymen and supers represented by a powerful union, 32BJ.

At increased risk to themselves, the staffs at most high-end buildings throughout the five boroughs find themselves scrambling to institute hygienic measures. They are also enforcing daily changing guidelines, establishing ad hoc networks of notification, caring for the old and vulnerable left behind by an exodus that has rendered the Upper East Side a ghost town. Were not a hazmat crew but were doing what we can, Jimmy Brennan, 40, the resident manager of a cooperative building on Fifth Avenue, said of his nine-member team. The trick here is anticipating the needs and problems before they come up. At Mr. Brennans building in the East 70s, that meant appealing to his board of directors well before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued stringent updated safety guidelines for a go-ahead to shut down the gym and common areas, to suspend nonemergency contractors, to seal off floors left vacant by tenants who fled the city and to establish a phone tree and daily wellness check-ins with those that remained. Our population is mostly aged 60 to 100, 85 is a pretty common number here, said Mr. Brennan, a third-generation building manager whose extended family oversees 30 separate buildings around New York.

None of these products have been shown to lower the likelihood of contracting the coronavirus or shortening its course, and taking large doses of them can potentially do harm. But experts say that the jump in sales suggests many people are desperate to strengthen their bodys immune defenses and ease their heightened anxiety levels. There are times when taking a supplement can be very useful, like during pregnancy or to address a clear nutrient deficiency. But for healthy adults who are worried about the coronavirus, eating a nutritious diet and getting proper sleep and exercise are the best ways to strengthen your immune system, said Linda Van Horn, chief of nutrition in the department of preventive medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

The last few weeks saw a surge in mortgage applications, especially from borrowers seeking to refinance in the face of low interest rates, and many of those loan closings are scheduled now. But the coronavirus outbreak has snarled many spring home-buying plans, as apartment buildings ban open houses, real estate agents shutter brokerages and quarantines make it tough to even step outside. Now, another obstacle: The closure of government recording offices, as all nonessential employees in New York and other states have been told to stay home. Squirreled away in county buildings, and probably not high on the list of things buyers care about, these offices are nevertheless vital to the buying and refinancing processes, as title searches and deed filings happen inside. Most lenders require a title search for refinancing. The machine is being overwhelmed at this point, said Bob Jennings, the chief executive of ClosingCorp, a tech platform involved in a third of the countrys home-loan applications. All told, as of Friday, about 1,000 of the countrys 3,600 recording offices had shut down or curtailed their hours, according to the American Land Title Association, a trade group crowdsourcing . A lack of staff doesnt totally derail business. About 2,100 of the 3,600 offices allow electronic filings. But a human being ultimately has to process those filings, known as e-recordings, so if no ones there, the pipeline is still blocked at the end, said Steve Gottheim, a senior counsel with the title association, which is urging officials to leave at least skeleton crews in the offices. If a deed fails to be recorded in a timely manner, lenders can get spooked by the potential for fraud. Without a public record, a devious seller could technically sell a house twice. READ MORE.

I sure am, which is a good thing considering how many kinds of beans I have on hand. Over the weekend, I put a couple of cans of beans to work in a quick vegetarian skillet chili. Like every recipe Im writing about lately, its very adaptable. You can use any kind  of beans, swap out the spices, skip the tomatoes or double them, if your can is bigger than mine. Skillet chili also happens to be fast and easy, good recipe traits whether youre overwhelmingly busy or anxious, or a little of each. This recipe starts, like many great dishes, by sauteing an onion or shallots or leeks in some oil with a pinch of salt . When tender and golden at the edges, add minced garlic and a jalapeno or other chile if you have one. Let it all cook until it starts to smell delicious, then add spices chili powder, cumin, coriander and let those toast for a minute to bring out their flavors. Crumble in some dried oregano or marjoram, if you like, and add two 15-ounce cans of drained beans  and any size can of tomatoes with their liquid.  Simmer it all for 15 to 20 minutes, so the flavors can meld. Taste, and add more salt and spices if the chili needs it. I like to serve this with sliced red onions that Ive soaked in lime juice, and a pinch each of salt and sugar. But jarred pickled peppers are great, too, as are sliced scallions and a nice, fat, optional dollop of sour cream or yogurt.

Across the United States, parents are settling into the idea that the current coronavirus outbreak will require many to take over for teachers and child care providers into the foreseeable future. On March 16, President Trump raised the possibility that the coronavirus crisis might last until August. With schools across the country closed and unlikely to reopen soon, families are gathering teaching materials, setting up schedules, and looking for ways to keep kids engaged beyond the limited hours of remote-learning school days. Parents who are pros at packing lunches and juggling sports practices may feel overwhelmed at the thought of managing students school days at home. My own children started their schools remote-learning on March 16 and, even as an educator with 20 years of experience and two masters degrees in the education field, organizing their schedule consumed my morning.

The results were overwhelming. More than 4,000 track and field athletes from six continents participated in the poll and 78 percent of them said the Summer Games should be postponed. In addition, 87 percent said the coronavirus outbreak had adversely affected their training, and the average concern for their health and safety was 68 on a scale of 1 to 100, with 100 representing the greatest concern, if the Games opened as planned on July 24.

There are times when the planet resets its course with a cruelty that seems as capricious as it is implacable. The coronavirus pandemic, spreading octopus tentacles into every crevice of society, is one of them, pitting the vanity of human assumptions against natures almost casual ability to destroy them. It is not the first time. Calamities and the mass destruction of populations and lives stretch back to biblical times and on through the days of plague in medieval Europe. Wars, too, have brought a Darwinian pruning of entire societies. Technological advance, from siege engines to long bows, from gas chambers to weapons of mass destruction, has magnified the process, culminating in the Cold Wars calculations of mutually assured destruction.

Having a doctor in the family is quite useful, even though it must be aggravating for him when we bother him at all hours about minor ailments outside his specialty. Lately its been especially helpful for us because my cousin, Dr. Christopher Siracusa, the director of the Gunnar Esiason Cystic Fibrosis Center at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital in Ohio, is a pulmonologist, or lung doctor, and Covid-19 is wreaking havoc on the respiratory system. As the virus has spread, so has the amount of people asking him questions: patients, caregivers, colleagues, friends and neighbors. Providing answers, he acknowledged, has been a somewhat daunting task as information sometimes changes hourly. What he does know quite a bit about is how to keep people occupied while quarantined for weeks at a time: Recurrent lung infections are common in patients with cystic fibrosis, a genetic, life-limiting, multisystem disease, and treatment often includes two to three weeks in the hospital in one room. We asked him to share a few tips and tricks that he uses with his patients:. 1. If youre working from home, start your work day normally. Wake up at the same time, shower if thats part of your routine. Comb your hair, brush your teeth, eat your normal breakfast. 2. Get dressed. Put on real clothes, ideally something with a button or zipper. If you cant wear sweatpants to work, wearing them at home wont help motivate you. Its also easier to gain weight if your pants can stretch with you. Bonus: If you wear sweatpants after work, set that sweatpants alarm it will give you something to look forward to!. 3. If youre working from home, actually work. If you dont have a TV on at work, or at school, dont have one on at home. Sit at a table or desk, not on your couch. 4. If youre using Zoom, Skype or any other platform for virtual meetings, put on your webcam. Were not used to meeting with black squares; were used to meeting with humans. If no one else has theirs on, be a trendsetter. 5. Lights on all day! Most of us dont work in the dark, so have your overhead lights on. 6. Take breaks. If you regularly take 30 minutes for lunch, take 30 for lunch. I encourage stretching, a quick walk . Also, stay hydrated. 7. Keep a normal-ish schedule. If youre typically done at 5, be done at 5. Just because youre working from home, doesnt mean you have to work 24/7. 8. Schedule everything, even the nonwork tasks. Include TV time, online shopping, social media, laundry, etc. Do this every morning itll help avoid what do I do next?. 9. Dont get in your comfy spot  until the sun goes down. Follow this rule. 10. Eat what you would normally eat on a work day. Save the fun food for the weekend. 11. Speaking of fun food, if youre like me, you have more food than youre used to having. I also bought a lot of carbs and processed food I dont typically eat. I recommend putting all the nonessential food in a container in another room. If you eat healthy, keep eating your normal fruits, veggies and meats. 12. Try to get exercise. Pretty much every online workout program is offering free trials right now take advantage. This helps pass the time, as well as keep your mind and body healthy. 13. Consider learning meditation or mindfulness. These times are stressful for everyone, regardless of who you are. Finding tools  to help cope are important for all of us. 14. If youre newly unemployed because of the pandemic, its OK to lick your wounds. Once youre ready, apply for all the help you can. Also, there could still be ways out there to make money including child care for children of health care workers like us. 15. Its good to stay informed by reading, watching or listening to the news, but limit it to one or two times a day, and try to avoid constantly looking things up. Otherwise, focus your energy on something else. Hang in there; this is a marathon, not a sprint. READ MORE. ADVERTISEMENT. March 23,2020, 9:16 a.m. ETMarch 23, 2020. March 23,2020, 9:16 a.m. ET. By .

As the coronavirus upends American life, Chinese-Americans face a double threat. Not only are they grappling like everyone else with how to avoid the virus itself, they are also contending with growing racism in the form of verbal and physical attacks. Other Asians-Americans with families from Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, Myanmar and other places are facing threats, too, lumped together with Chinese-Americans by a bigotry that does not know the difference. In interviews over the past week, nearly two dozen Asian-Americans across the country said they were afraid to go grocery shopping, to travel alone on subways or buses, to let their children go outside. Many described being yelled at in public a sudden spasm of hate that is reminiscent of the kind faced by Muslim-Americans after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But unlike 2001, when President George W. Bush urged tolerance of Muslim-Americans," this time President Trump is using language that Asian-Americans say is inciting racist attacks."""

And health care workers are the soldiers on the front lines. Out of Spains 40,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, 5,400 nearly 14 percent are medical professionals, the health ministry said on Tuesday. No other country has reported health care staff accounting for a double-digit percentage of total infections. But the problem is widespread throughout Europe. In Italy, France and Spain, more than 30 health care professionals have died of the coronavirus, and thousands of others have had to self-isolate. In Brescia province, the center of Italys outbreak, 10 to 15 percent of doctors and nurses have been infected and put out of commission, according to a doctor there. In France, the public hospital system in Paris has tallied 490 infected staff members, a small but growing proportion of the systems 100,000 or so employees. The same dynamics are starting to take hold in Britain and the United States, where the contagion is bearing down but has yet to fully bite. Unlock more free articles.

Some of our doctors unfortunately worked without adequate protection and acted as vectors.

It has not helped that Spains population, on average, is among the worlds oldest. But the government on the movement of people. Even as a tragedy unfolded in northern Italy, mass events went ahead earlier this month in Madrid, and the government waited until March 14 to declare a state of emergency that has since forced people to stay indoors, barring exceptional circumstances.

You are used to taking care of others and now youre being asked to stay home and take care of yourself, said Marc Arnaiz, a doctor in the internal medicine unit of the Igualada hospital, who tested positive earlier this month. For most of us this job is a vocation, so its shocking and frustrating, he said. Mr. Arnaiz, 31, said he had likely been infected by a patient. He noticed the first symptoms on March 9, the day his patient was confirmed positive, among the first in the hospital, which has since become one of the worst infection clusters in northeastern Spain. While its impossible to know how many patients infected doctors and vice versa, the alarming spread within hospitals has forced the government to struggle with a shortage of both professionals and equipment. Last week, the government launched an emergency recruitment plan to add 50,000 health care workers, ranging from medical students to retired doctors. After employees began complaining openly about the stresses on the system, some Madrid hospitals told their staff not to speak out. Many of those interviewed by The New York Times were not authorized to comment publicly and asked that their full names not be used for fear of retribution. One, Yolanda, has been a nurse for 30 years, working in a public hospital in Madrid. But earlier this month, as the outbreak worsened in Spain, she said she was moved instead to a makeshift emergency ward, where she had to learn new skills on the job while working without decent protective gear. Weve been put on the front line not only without enough protection, but also sometimes with the stress of a very different work environment, she said, noting that she had never before handled intubated patients. The nurses in her unit wore face masks and gowns, but they had to reuse them because of a shortage. Putting on a face mask again and again is as useless as sticking a piece of paper on your face, she said. Last Thursday, Yolanda went home feeling feverish. On Sunday, she tested positive for coronavirus, along with about 30 colleagues. We have done our best, but some of us sadly became part of the contamination chain, she said.

When we already knew that the virus was circulating in hospitals, we were still being told that the usage of protective gear should be limited to specific circumstances, said Juanjo Menendez, the communications director of SATSE Madrid, a nurses union. Its the kind of basic error that a student learns to avoid in the first year of medical school. In Spain, France and Italy, officials and health care professionals said they were shocked by equipment shortages. Giorgio Gori, the mayor of Bergamo, one of the hardest hit towns in Italy, said the doctors werent protected, and lacked the sufficient defenses, adding that he was still receiving requests for masks and gloves from doctors making home visits. Jean-Paul Hamon, the president of one of Frances biggest doctor unions, on Tuesday that he was particularly worried about workers who are not in hospitals but are still in close contact with patients, like general practitioners or retirement home employees. Three of the five doctors who have died of Covid-19 so far in France were general practitioners, and one was a gynecologist. The state is absolutely unprepared, said Mr. Hamon, who is himself infected. The state is going to owe an explanation. In Spain, doctors warned that hospitals were now paying the price of the loose measures announced in the early days of the outbreak. The lack of protection is everywhere, the improvisation seems to be widespread, said Antonio Antela, a doctor who coordinates the infectious disease unit at the university hospital of Santiago de Compostela, in northwestern Spain. He has been hospitalized for a week after developing pneumonia and testing positive. The lesson is: take care of your public health care system, because there will be other epidemics and we ought to be better prepared, he added in a telephone interview from his hospital bed. Hospitals in Italy and France have also been hard by sick workers and depleted supplies.Credit...Nadia Shira Cohen for The New York Times. At a medical center in the heart of Madrid, Maria, another nurse who is now isolated at home with coronavirus, said that she spent several days working without a face mask and gloves, handing out masks only to visitors who reported breathing problems or had recently been in Italy. On March 11, the day she first felt fever, her medical center finally ordered all staff to wear masks. We probably didnt have enough face masks, but we also acted for far too long as if this was a limited problem, mostly imported from Italy, she said. The Spanish government is now stepping up efforts to buy medical equipment, as well as distributing about 650,000 new test kits across the country. Two Chinese cargo planes filled with face masks and other gear landed in Madrid and Zaragoza on Tuesday. We are a target like everybody else, but we are also a threat to other co-workers, said Juan, a 37-year-old doctor in a Madrid public hospital.

The Senate voted unanimously on Wednesday to approve a sweeping, to shore up the United States economy as it weathers the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic, advancing the largest fiscal stimulus package in modern American history. The House was expected to quickly take up the bill on Friday and pass it, sending it to President Trump for his signature. The legislation would send direct payments of $1,200 to Americans earning up to $75,000 which would gradually phase out for higher earners and end for those with incomes more than $99,000 and an additional $500 per child. It would substantially expand jobless aid, providing an additional 13 weeks and a four-month enhancement of benefits, extending them for the first time to freelancers and gig workers and adding $600 per week on top of the usual payment. The measure would also provide $350 billion in federally guaranteed loans to small businesses and establish a $500 billion government lending program for distressed companies reeling from the impact of the crisis, allowing the administration to take equity stakes in airlines that received aid to help compensate taxpayers. It would also send $100 billion to hospitals on the front lines of the pandemic. Unlock more free articles. The bill was the product of intense bipartisan negotiations among Republicans, Democrats and the White House. Three senators were absent from the late-night roll call because of the novel coronavirus. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, has contracted Covid-19, while two Utah Republicans, Senators Mitt Romney and Mike Lee, were in self-isolation out of an abundance of caution after spending time with Mr. Paul.

Fauci sees signs of the virus becoming cyclical, like the flu. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Wednesday that he was seeing indications that the virus could keep returning as a seasonal, cyclic thing, like the flu. One of the key questions about the virus has been whether its spread would slow or stop in warm weather and return in cold weather, and Dr. Fauci suggested that it may follow that seasonal pattern. What we are starting to see now in the southern hemisphere, he said, referring specifically to southern Africa, is that we are having cases that are appearing as they go into their winter season. And if, in fact, they have a substantial outbreak, it will be inevitable that we need to be prepared that we will get a cycle around the second time. That makes it all the more important that scientists have a vaccine available for that next cycle, as well as a menu of drugs that we have shown to be effective and shown to be safe, he said.

A prescribed burn in Union County, Ga., last year.Credit...Dustin Chambers for The New York Times. As much of the Western United States braces for another fire season, which typically ramps up in the middle of May, some wildland managers find themselves with one less tool in their arsenal to mitigate risk. Prescribed burns, in which firefighters deliberately set lands ablaze with the goal of reducing brush, grasses and other easily ignitable material that can help fuel large fires, have been postponed in all Forest Service regions because of concerns over the coronavirus. This decision to temporarily postpone ignitions will prevent any effects from smoke that might further worsen conditions for those who are at risk in our communities, Imani Lester, the acting National Press Officer for the United States Forest Service said in an email. Older adults and people with underlying conditions like asthma are especially at risk for suffering adverse reactions to smoke from wildfires, which in recent years have been made worse by climate change. They are also more likely to become more severely ill from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. Prescribed or controlled burns are planned to burn at lower intensity than wildfires and generate less air pollution as a result. They are typically managed in such a way to minimize the number of people who are affected by the smoke. And firefighters who primarily perform prescribed burns have a lower overall risk than those who perform other forms of wildland firefighting. The postponement comes as much of the West is experiencing in part because the coronavirus has led to fewer people driving and flying. FIREFIGHTERS AND CORONAVIRUS.

The frustrating thing about all of this is it really just feels like its too little, too late. Like we knew we knew it was coming. Today is kind of getting worse and worse. We had to get a refrigerated truck to store the bodies of patients who are dying. We are, right now, scrambling to try to get a few additional ventilators or even CPAP machines. If we could get CPAP machines, we could free up ventilators for patients who need them. You know, we now have these five vents. We probably unless people die, I suspect well be back to needing to beg for ventilators again in another day or two. Theres a mythical 100 vents out there which we havent seen. Leaders in various offices, from the president to the head of Health and Hospitals, saying things like, Were going to be fine. Everythings fine. And from our perspective, everything is not fine. I dont have the support that I need, and even just the materials that I need, physically, to take care of my patients. And its America, and were supposed to be a first-world country. On a regular day, my emergency departments volume is pretty high. Its about 200 people a day. Now were seeing 400 or more people a day. At first, we were trying to isolate patients with cough and fever and be more careful around them, but we werent necessarily being extra careful around all the other patients. And then we started to realize that patients who were coming in with no fever but abdominal pain actually had findings on their X-rays and chest CTs that were consistent with this coronavirus, Covid-19. So someone in a car accident gets brought in and we get a CT scan of them, and their lungs look like they have coronavirus. We were seeing a lot of patients who probably had Covid, but we didnt realize. Ten residents and also many, many of our nurses and a few of the attending physicians got sick. The anxiety of this situation is really overwhelming. All of the doctors, its hard for us to get tested even if we want to, even if we have symptoms. Were exposed over and over again. We dont have the protective equipment that we should have. I put on one N95 mask in the morning. I need to have that N95 mask on for every patient I see. I dont take it off all day. The N95 mask I wore today is also the N95 mask I wore on Friday. Were always worried that well be out of N95 masks. Whats a little bit scary now is the patients that were getting are much sicker. Many of the young people who are getting sick dont smoke, theyre healthy, they have no co-morbidities. Theyre just young, regular people between the ages of 30 and 50 who you would not expect to get this sick. So many people are saying its going to be OK, everythings fine, we have what we need. And if this goes on for a month or two or three or five like it did in China, and were already this strained, we dont have what we need. I dont really care if I get in trouble for speaking to the media. I want people to know that this is bad. People are dying. We dont have the tools that we need in the emergency department and in the hospital to take care of them, and and its really hard. 00:00. 5:33. 5:33People Are Dying: 72 Hours Inside a N.Y.C.

Recovered coronavirus patients appear to gain immunity to the virus, scientists say, . Now they are testing treatments that could help end the pandemic. On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of plasma from recovered patients to treat some severe cases. And New York will begin testing serum from people who have recovered from the virus to treat those who are seriously ill. A study in macaques infected with the new coronavirus suggested that once infected, the monkeys produce neutralizing antibodies and resist further infection. But it is unclear how long the monkeys, or people, would remain immune. Still, even if people become reinfected, the second bout with the coronavirus would likely be much milder than the first, said Florian Krammer, a microbiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. The quickest way to assess immunity is a test that looks for protective antibodies in the blood of people who have recovered. Antibody tests are used in a handful of countries, but are just widely coming to market in the West. Before the method can be put into wide use, scientists must address certain safety issues. Some pharmaceutical companies are hoping to sidestep some of those concerns by developing antibodies against the coronavirus in the laboratory. VIRUS IMMUNITY.

Pennsylvania would be the sixth state to shift its primary to June 2, joining five other contests already scheduled for that Tuesday. Even as the calendar shifted, state officials and voting rights advocates were concerned that the $400 million included in the Senate stimulus package to safeguard elections is far less than the amount states will need across the nation.

President Hassan Rouhani of Iran announced new restrictions on travel and public gatherings on Wednesday, in a belated attempt to contain the growing spread of the virus. The rules will be in effect for nine days starting Thursday and ban travel in or out of cities unless for emergency purposes, the government said. Nonessential private businesses and open public spaces, including parks and gardens, were ordered to shut down. Violations will be penalized, the government warned. People must adjust to more difficult circumstances because we have no choice. Saving the lives of people is very important to us, Mr. Rouhani said. The majority of the governments 2.4 million employees would be told to stay home, with exceptions in the health care and banking sectors, a government spokesman said. The move comes after Mr. Rouhani was criticized for his management of the crisis, particularly for allowing Iranians to travel across the country last week for Nowruz, the Persian New Year. Irans transportation police estimated that 8.5 million people traveled for the holiday, risking further spread of the virus. Irans health ministry said on Thursday that there were 27,017 cases across the country and that 2,077 people had died, including 43 medical workers.

Scientists warned that the United States someday would become the country hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic. That moment arrived on Thursday. In the United States, at least 81,321 people are known to , including more than 1,000 deaths more cases than China, Italy or any other country has seen, according to data gathered by The New York Times. The Times is engaged in a comprehensive effort to track the details of every confirmed case in the United States, collecting information from federal, state and local officials. With 330 million residents, the United States is the worlds third most populous nation, meaning it provides a vast pool of people who can potentially get Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. And it is a sprawling, cacophonous democracy, where states set their own policies and President Trump has sent mixed messages about the scale of the danger and how to fight it, ensuring there was no coherent, unified response to a grave public health threat. A series of missteps and lost opportunities dogged the nations response. Among them: a failure to take the pandemic seriously even as it engulfed China, a deeply flawed effort to provide broad testing for the virus that left the country blind to the extent of the crisis, and a dire shortage of masks and protective gear to protect doctors and nurses on the front lines, as well as ventilators to keep the critically ill alive.

This country has an unsurpassed medical system supported by trillions of dollars from insurers, Medicare and Medicaid. Armies of doctors transplant hearts and cure cancer. The public health system, limping along on local tax receipts, kills mosquitoes and traces the contacts of people with sexually transmitted diseases. It has been outmatched by the pandemic. There was no Pentagon ready to fight the war on this pandemic, no wartime draft law. There was eventually a White House Coronavirus Task Force, but it has been led by politicians, not medical experts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is one of the great disease-detective agencies in the world, and its doctors have contributed mightily in skirmishes against Ebola, Zika and any number of other health threats. But the agency retreated into silence, its director, Dr. Robert Redfield, almost invisible humbled by a fiasco in the failure to produce basic diagnostic testing. Now at least 160 million Americans have been ordered to stay home in states from California to New York. Schools are closed, often along with bars, restaurants and many other businesses. Hospitals are coping with soaring numbers of patients in New York City, even as supplies of essential protective gear and equipment dwindle. Other hospitals, other communities fear what may be coming. We are the new global epicenter of the disease, said Dr. Sara Keller, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins Medicine. Now, all we can do is to slow the transmission as much as possible by hunkering down in our houses while, as a country, we ramp up production of personal protective equipment, materials needed for testing, and ventilators. The world will be a different place when the pandemic is over. India may surpass the United States as the country with the most deaths. Like the United States, it, too, is a vast democracy with deep internal divisions. But its population, 1.3 billion, is far larger, and its people are crowded even more tightly into megacities. China could still stumble into a new round of contagion as its economy restarts, and be forced to do it all again. In the meantime, with the virus loose in the streets while millions of Americans huddle indoors, when will it be safe to come out and go back to work?. The virus will tell us, said Dr. William Schaffner, a preventive medicine specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical School. When a baseline of daily testing is established across the country, a drop in the percentage of positive tests will signal that the virus has found as many hosts as it can for the moment, and is beginning to recede. When hospital admissions have hit a clear peak and begun to plateau, we can feel optimistic, Dr. Schaffner said. And when they begin to drop, we can begin to smile. That moment may arrive this summer.

And he attacked Democratic governors for being insufficiently grateful for his efforts. Think of it, 22 days ago we had the greatest economy in the world, Mr. Trump said at a news conference. Everything was going beautifully. The stock market hit an all-time high again for the over 150th time during my presidency.

The legislation will send direct payments of $1,200 to millions of Americans, including those earning up to $75,000, and an additional $500 per child. It will substantially expand jobless aid, providing an additional 13 weeks and a four-month enhancement of benefits, and for the first time will extend the payments to freelancers and gig workers. The measure will also offer $377 billion in federally guaranteed loans to small businesses and establish a $500 billion government lending program for distressed companies reeling from the crisis, including allowing the administration the ability to take equity stakes in airlines that received aid to help compensate taxpayers. It will also send $100 billion to hospitals on the front lines of the pandemic. The law was the product of days of talks between members of Mr. Trumps administration and Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress. And even before Mr. Trump held a bill signing on Friday afternoon, congressional leaders said they expected to negotiate more legislative responses to the pandemic in the coming months.

In addition, 92 percent of cities reported a shortage of test kits and 85 percent did not have a sufficient supply of ventilators available to local health facilities. Roughly two-thirds of the cities said they had not received any emergency equipment or supplies from their state, the report said. And of those that did receive state aid, nearly 85 percent said it was not enough to meet their needs. In total, the conference tabulated that cities need 28.5 million face masks, 24.4 million other items of personal protection equipment, 7.9 million test kits and 139,000 ventilators.

For days Mr. Trump to mobilize private industry to produce the critically-needed supplies, arguing at points that private industry was stepping up on its own, and at other points suggesting dismissively that using it would be analogous to nationalizing businesses. But on Friday afternoon Mr. Trump said that he had directed his administration to use any and all authority available under the Defense Production Act to require General Motors to accept, perform, and prioritize Federal contracts for ventilators. Our negotiations with G.M. regarding its ability to supply ventilators have been productive, but our fight against the virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course, the president said in a statement. G.M. was wasting time. Todays action will help ensure the quick production of ventilators that will save American lives. Earlier on Friday, Mr. Trump at General Motors on Friday, blaming it for overpromising on its ability to make new ventilators for critically ill coronavirus patients. In a series of tweets, the president had emphasized the urgent need for the ventilators, an abrupt change of tone from the night before, when he had told Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, that states were inflating their needs.

The coronavirus mostly infects the lungs, causing pneumonia in severe cases; the typical symptoms are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. But some infected patients, including one recently in Brooklyn, have arrived at the hospital with symptoms . On close examination, the Brooklyn patient and some others were suffering from acute myocarditis, a severe inflammation of the heart. The condition also has been seen in patients with other viral infections, and. Patients with coronavirus infections and heart complications have a risk of death nearly four times higher than patients without heart complications. Other doctors have been keeping a close watch on the viruss impact on the youngest targets. Newborns and babies have so far seemed to be largely unaffected by the coronavirus, but three small new studies suggest that the virus may reach the fetus in utero. Even in these studies the newborns seem only mildly affected, if at all. That is reassuring, experts said; in theory, the virus could pose a risk to the fetus early in gestation, when the fetal brain is most vulnerable. We dont have any knowledge of that at all, said Dr. Christina Chambers, a perinatal epidemiologist at the University of California in San Diego. That is a complete open question at this point.

After four passengers died aboard Holland Americas Zaandam cruise ship, the fate of the vessel became increasingly unclear on Friday night when it was denied permission to cross the Panama Canal. The ship is currently off the southern coast of Panama, conducting an evacuation of healthy passengers to one of the companys sister ships, the Rotterdam. The Panama Canal Authority saying that new health regulations aimed at preventing contagious diseases would prohibit the Zaandam from crossing the canal. Both ships had hoped to cross the Panama Canal and head to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which has not given them permission to dock.

C.D.C. issues a travel advisory for the New York region, after Trump backs off his quarantine threat. President Trump said Saturday night that he will not impose a quarantine on New York, New Jersey and Connecticut but would instead issue a strong travel advisory to be implemented by the governors of the three states. Mr. Trump made the announcement on Twitter just hours after telling reporters that he was considering a quarantine of the three states in an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus to Florida and other states. Later Saturday night, the C.D.C. issued a formal advisory urging the residents of the three states to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately. The advisory, which was posted to the agencys website and its Twitter account, does not apply to employees of critical infrastructure industries, the agency said. That includes trucking, public health professionals, financial services and food supply workers. Mr. Trump, when he said he was considering a quarantine for the region, offered no details about how his administration would enforce it. Speaking to CNN, Gov.

Maryland on Saturday announced an outbreak at a Mount Airy nursing home where 66 residents tested positive and 11 have been hospitalized. The national total stands above 119,000, and Mr. Trump has been under substantial pressure from state officials to do more to quell the crisis. The specter of a federal quarantine followed a wave of governors who, fearful about the virus spreading further through their states, ordered people who had traveled from New York to isolate themselves for two weeks after their arrivals. Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island said Friday that state troopers would begin stopping drivers with New York license plates so that National Guard officials could collect contact information and inform anyone coming from the state that they were subject to a mandatory, 14-day quarantine. Texas, Florida, Maryland and South Carolina are among the other states that have ordered people arriving from New York to self-quarantine. In Texas, for instance, Friday that Department of Public Safety agents would make surprise visits to see whether travelers were adhering to the states mandate, and they warned that violators could be fined $1,000 and jailed for 180 days. Mr. Lamont, the Connecticut governor, this week urged all travelers from New York City to self-quarantine for two weeks upon entering the state, but he stopped short of issuing an order requiring it.

The agency leading the nations coronavirus response said , with another four cases pending, though in a letter to its employees union, it declined a request to say where they were located, prompting criticism from the union that the agency was jeopardizing public health. Union leaders last week had asked the agency, Federal Emergency Management Agency, how many employees had tested positive, and in which offices, so that workers who might have interacted with those people could decide whether to get tested as well. On Friday, FEMA turned down the request, saying the union did not need to know, according to a copy of the agencys letter that was reviewed by The New York Times.

Mr. de Blasio also said that a few houses of worship were continuing to hold religious services and that they risked fines or having their buildings permanently closed if the police found congregations in them this weekend.

Italy and Spain, which have the worlds highest coronavirus death tolls, have reported grim new daily totals: 889 deaths over 24 hours in Italy, and 832 in Spain. The swelling figures brought the fatality counts in the two countries to about 15,000 more than half of the deaths reported worldwide. We have to reduce to the maximum this mortality, Fernando Simon, the director of Spains national health emergency center, said. But the health system in Spain, where the government on Saturday further tightened restrictions on movement, is under strain. Dr. Simon warned that some intensive care units had reached the limit, while others were approaching their capacities. In the Madrid region, a hub of Spains outbreak, about 1,400 patients are now in intensive care units. The surge in deaths was particularly unsettling in Italy, where it had seemed the fatality rate had begun to slow. More encouragingly to public health experts, Italy and Spain have both reported signs that new infections are becoming fewer, although those rates could wobble as the outbreaks progress. We are reaching the peak of this curve that worries us so much, Dr. Simon said. In some areas of the country we have probably already passed it, he added. We Take the Dead From Morning Till Night. No country has been hit harder by the coronavirus than Italy, and no province has suffered as many losses as Bergamo. Photos and voices from there evoke a portrait of despair.

Even so, he said, We cant delude ourselves that a slowing down of the diffusion will allow us to slow down social distancing.

The measure will come into force at all vehicle, rail and pedestrian checkpoints, and apply to Russias maritime borders, the government said. It will not apply to Russian diplomats and the drivers of freight trucks, among others. The country, which has already grounded all international flights, has reported 1,264 coronavirus cases.

The coronavirus prompted Denmark and Norway to close borders, shut down restaurants and ski slopes and keep students at their homes. The most populous Scandinavian country closed its high schools and colleges but kept its preschools, grade schools, pubs, restaurants and borders open. The countrys approach has raised questions about whether its gambling with a disease, Covid-19, that has no cure or vaccine, or if its tactic will be seen as a savvy strategy to fight a scourge that has laid waste to millions of jobs and prompted global lockdowns. By Saturday, Norway, population 5.3 million, had more than 3,770 coronavirus cases and 19 deaths; Denmark, population 5.6 million, reported 2,200 cases and 52 deaths; Sweden, with 10.12 million people, recorded more than 3,060 cases and 105 deaths.

Thats the way we work in Sweden, the state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, said. Our whole system for communicable disease control is based on voluntary action. The immunization system is completely voluntary and there is 98 percent coverage. Just across the Oresund Bridge, another Scandinavian country is pursuing a strategy to limit the economic fallout that stands in contrast with steps taken by some other nations, including the United States, which on Friday approved a $2.2 trillion stimulus package. In , political parties from across the ideological spectrum joined with labor unions and employers associations this month to unite behind a plan that has the government covering 75 to 90 percent of all worker salaries over the next three months, provided that companies refrain from layoffs. The government also agreed to cover costs like rent for companies that suffer a shortfall in revenues. These two elements are collectively estimated to cost 42.6 billion Danish kroner , after factoring in the savings on the unemployment insurance system.

To stay resilient in frightening times, its critical to remember that gleams of hope do exist. Whenever Ive asked people what thing theyre most proud of in their lives, its always connected to times of pain or strife or struggle and how they got through it, said Jeremy Ortman, a mental health counselor in New York. So what bright spots are there to keep in mind during this pandemic?. Kindness is in the news. Maybe people are being better to each other, or maybe were just noticing it more. People each other across windowsills. Animal shelters are . Volunteers are for their neighbors. Research is moving at breakneck speed. Doctors are scrambling and . The mobilization in the medical field recalls organizing efforts during World War II, said Robert Citino, executive director of the Institute for the Study of War and Democracy at the National World War II Museum in New Orleans. I dont think there has ever been more human ingenuity devoted to a single scientific problem than the one were facing right now, he said. We could be learning crucial lessons. Years from now, if a deadlier virus emerges, we may find that todays innovations and procedures have prepared us for it. What were facing is unprecedented, and I dont want to downplay its seriousness, but its not the worst-case scenario, said Malia Jones, a researcher who studies infectious diseases at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. I hope the takeaway here is that well be better prepared to deal with the next pandemic, Dr. Jones said. This is a good practice run for a novel influenza pandemic. Thats the real scary scenario.

Pedestrians on the corner of Fulton Street and Nostrand Avenue in New York.Credit...Jonah Markowitz for The New York Times. As the coronavirus pandemic rages on, experts have started to question official guidance about whether ordinary, healthy people should protect themselves with a regular surgical mask, or even a scarf. The recent surge in infections in the United States means that more Americans are now at risk of getting sick. And healthy individuals, especially those with essential jobs who cannot avoid public transportation or close interaction with others, may need to start wearing masks more regularly, some doctors say. However, with even front-line medical workers complaining of shortages, few people are likely to be able to find them. The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continue to state that masks dont necessarily protect healthy individuals from getting infected as they go about their daily lives. The official guidance continues to recommend that masks be reserved for people who are already sick, as well as for the health workers and caregivers who interact with infected individuals on a regular basis. Everyone else, they say, should stick to frequent hand-washing and maintaining a distance of at least six feet from other people to protect themselves. While wearing a mask may not prevent healthy people from getting sick, and doesnt replace important measures such as hand-washing or social distancing, it may be better than nothing, said Dr. Robert Atmar, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine. Studies of influenza pandemics have shown that when high-grade N95 masks are not available, surgical masks protect people . If everyone in the community wears a mask, it could decrease transmission, Dr. Neil Fishman, the chief medical officer of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, said. But unfortunately I think that we dont have enough masks to make that effective policy in the U.S. S",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Birx, behind him, leads the White Houses coronavirus task force.Credit...Al Drago for The New York Times. 200,000 Americans could die even if the U.S. takes aggressive action, Fauci says. Two of the top doctors advising President Trump on the coronavirus pandemic warned on Sunday that as many as 200,000 Americans could die during the outbreak, even with much of the country already under stay-at-home orders and practicing social distancing. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the nations leading infectious disease expert, said that the grim projection was based on scientific modeling, and the forecasts had convinced Mr. Trump to extend social distancing guidelines through the end of April. I think its entirely conceivable that if we do not mitigate to the extent that were trying to do that you could reach that number, Dr. Fauci said. Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the lead coordinator of the White Houses coronavirus task force, said that without any precautionary measures, the same models projected that 1.6 million to 2.2 million Americans could die from complications of the virus.

President Trump at the White House on Sunday.Credit...Pete Marovich for The New York Times. President Trump said Sunday that the federal governments guidelines for social distancing , backing down from his previous comments that he hoped the country could go back to work by Easter. He had clashed with public health experts around the country when he suggested that the guidelines which urge people to stay at home and not to gather in groups of more than 10 might be relaxed by April 12. His announcement on Sunday indicated that he had backed down from that suggestion. A commercial aircraft carrying gloves, masks, gowns and other medical supplies from Shanghai in New York earlier on Sunday, the first of 22 scheduled flights that White House officials say will funnel much-needed goods to the United States by early April. The plane carried 130,000 N95 masks, nearly 1.8 million surgical masks and gowns, 10 million gloves and more than 70,000 thermometers, said Lizzie Litzow, a spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA will provide the majority of the supplies to New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, with the rest going to nursing homes in the area and other high-risk areas across the country, a White House spokesman said. While the supplies will be welcomed by hospitals and health care workers some of whom have resorted to rationing protective gear or using homemade supplies they represent just a tiny portion of what American hospitals need. The Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that the United States will require 3.5 billion masks in the event of a pandemic lasting a year. The pandemic has started a race among foreign governments, American governors and mayors, good Samaritans and opportunists to acquire protective gear, ventilators and other goods from China, the source of more than one-third of medical supplies in the United States in 2019. While Chinas own coronavirus epidemic has subsided since February, newly built factory lines in the country are beginning to churn out masks, gowns and gloves. The flights are the product of a public-private partnership led by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trumps son-in-law and a White House senior adviser in which the administration is looking to health care distributors like McKesson Corporation, Cardinal, Owens & Minor, Medline, and Henry Schein. With pleas from state and city leaders for more medical supplies, and questions raised about his interactions with some of them, Mr. Trump on Sunday acknowledged that he would delegate calls to governors typically Democrats that he has had personal disagreements with, doubling down on his assertion that the governors need to treat him fairly. I dont have to call because Im probably better off not, Mr. Trump said. I get Mike Pence to call. I get the head of FEMA to call. I get the admiral to call. MEDICAL SUPPLIES.

Two of the nations largest health insurers, Cigna and Humana, agreed to protect their customers from out-of-pocket costs if they need treatment for Covid-19, a decision that represents a rapid change in how companies are responding to the pandemic. Describing the insurers decision as a big deal, President Trump on Sunday said the companies dont waive co-pays too easily, but we asked them and they did it. While insurers and government officials have taken steps in recent weeks when they get tested, the bills associated with treatment for Covid-19 . Updated 5m ago. More live coverage: . Lets take the economic burden and the economic uncertainty off the table, said David M. Cordani, the chief executive of Cigna, in an interview before the White House briefing. Under the new policy, customers dont have to worry about the financial burden of the virus while their lives are being turned upside down, said Bruce Broussard, the chief executive of Humana. Both Mr. Cordani and Mr. Broussard said they hoped other insurers would follow suit. Last week, another large insurer, Aetna, now part of CVS Health, said it would also waive cost-sharing related to hospital stays. Employers that self-insure provide coverage to the majority of workers in this country, and they would not be affected by the insurers decision. They would have to decide individually whether they would take similar action. It is going to be a client-by-client decision, Mr. Cordani said. Whether individuals will be completely free of any surprise medical bills is also unclear, given the frequent disputes that normally arise between insurers and hospitals and doctors. People who get care from doctors outside their plans network could also still potentially face unpaid bills. Neither Cigna nor Humana said it had calculated the expected cost of the virus over the coming year, but one recent analysis said insurers, employers and individuals could .

President Trumps discussion of a quarantine of the New York region over the weekend confused many tri-state area residents and raised questions about the limits of presidential power. I had a lot of phone calls yesterday when the president first suggested some form of quarantine, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said on Sunday. I know we feel under attack. Mr. Trump backed away from the idea following criticism from Mr. Cuomo and other leaders. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention instead issued a formal advisory Saturday night urging residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to refrain from nonessential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately. The to employees of critical infrastructure industries, the agency said. That includes trucking, public health professionals, financial services and food supply workers. Mr. Trump denied on Sunday that the prospect of a quarantine was a threat. I didnt go around threatening, he said during a White House briefing. Sign up to receive our daily Coronavirus Briefing, an informed guide with the latest developments and expert advice. Sign Up. He raised the idea because the region has the most confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, but he offered no details about how his administration would enforce it. Mr. Cuomo later questioned whether the federal government had the authority to order a quarantine. Yes, New York is the epicenter and these are different times, and many people are frightened, Mr. Cuomo said on Sunday. Some of the reactions you get from individuals, even from governments, are frightening and suggesting that theyll take abrupt actions against New York. But look, this is New York and we are going to make it through this. As of Sunday evening, at least 141,096 people across every state, plus Washington, D.C., and four U.S. territories, have tested positive for the virus, according to a New York Times database. At least 2,469 patients with the virus have died. And at least 20 states now have more than 1,000 known cases within their borders. New York remains by far the hardest hit. On Sunday, Mr. Cuomo said the total number of cases in New York was 59,513, an increase of nearly 7,200 confirmed from the day before. More than half of the cases, or 33,768, are in New York City. The number of deaths in the state passed 1,000, up 272 from the day before the largest one-day increase in deaths since the outbreak began. About 8,500 people are currently hospitalized, an increase of 16 percent from Saturday to Sunday. Of those, 2,037 are in intensive care units, which are equipped with ventilators. NEW YORK. Syria reports its first coronavirus death. Sanitizing a classroom in Aza, Syria, on Thursday.Credit...Khalil Ashawi/Reuters. As the coronavirus pandemic has sickened more than 700,000 people worldwide and killed over 30,000, the Syrian government reported the first death from the virus in its territory on Sunday, about a week after announcing its first confirmed case. The outbreak, if uncontrolled, could shred a health care system already enfeebled by more than nine years of civil war. After the virus had struck neighboring countries, the Syrian government did not acknowledge any confirmed cases for weeks, even as rumors spread of hospitalizations and deaths from pneumonia-like diseases. But Syria has now confirmed 10 cases, including the patient who died on Sunday, according to a state news agency. The government had already moved to fend off an outbreak before announcing its first case. It closed schools and universities, limited working hours, banned gatherings, postponed parliamentary elections and built quarantine centers. Syrians are now subject to a nightly curfew between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. But Syrians and recent visitors to the country said in interviews that daily life appeared to continue much as usual. Marketplaces and streets were crowded; few wore masks or gloves. The health care system would be rapidly overwhelmed in a full-blown outbreak, aid workers say. Many doctors and nurses have fled the country, and hospitals were bombed and never rebuilt, leaving large swaths of the population with limited access to medical care. U.S. and European sanctions make it difficult to import supplies. The W.H.O. has delivered testing kits and protective equipment for health care workers, but medical aid groups that operate in the country have found their efforts to prepare hampered by the new restrictions on working hours and on gathering. Basic services have been all but decimated, said Rachel Sider, a Syrian policy adviser at the Norwegian Refugee Council. Its impossible to imagine how this country can cope with an outbreak. Public officials around the world have continued to struggle with the pandemic. In Russia, Moscow declared a lockdown starting Monday. People must not leave home except in an emergency or to go to the nearest grocery store or walk their dogs, going no further than 100 meters. People will still be able to enter and leave the city. Russia has reported 1,534 confirmed cases of coronavirus, far fewer than many Western countries, but the numbers have risen rapidly in recent days particularly in Moscow, which accounts for most of the cases. The police in South Africa that it had set up roadblocks and were checking vehicles on Sunday to ensure that people across the country complied with the regulations of the 21-day lockdown. Italy reported more than 97,689 cases of the coronavirus, an increase of more than 5,200 from Saturday. The number of deaths totaled 10,779, an increase of 756 from Saturday. HEART OF THE OUTBREAK. Once known as a wealthy Italian province, . France reported 40,174 cases, an increase of 2,599 from the day before. The country reported 2,606 deaths, an increase of 292 from Saturday. But there has been a decline in the percentage increase in new deaths reported on each of the last three days, to 13 percent Sunday from 27 percent on Thursday. Two high-speed trains started carrying patients from eastern France, one of the more affected regions, to hospitals along Frances western coast, where the outbreak has been limited so far. Englands deputy chief medical officer said on Sunday that Britons may be under some form of lockdown for six months or longer, warning that the country faces a second wave of coronavirus if they are lifted too quickly. Britain had over 17,000 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Sunday including , who was initially reluctant to introduce social distancing measures in the country, and , the heir to the British throne.

The Zaandam, a Holland America cruise ship on which four passengers died, will be allowed to transit the Panama Canal, after authorities initially . The ship was supposed to let its passengers disembark in Chile two weeks ago but was refused entry, so it headed to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where the ship does not yet have permission to dock. A week ago, people on the ship started getting sick. The company said on Friday that around 180 people, including 110 members of the crew, have flulike symptoms and two have tested positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Those who are sick and their close contacts will stay onboard, and everyone else will be transferred to the Rotterdam, another cruise ship, which arrived in Panama from Mexico to deliver supplies, coronavirus tests and doctors. Crew members aboard the Rotterdam told The New York Times that they felt tricked because they were told they were going to Panama to deliver supplies only to learn that they would also take on hundreds of passengers who had been exposed to the virus. Some crew members have refused to come out of their cabins and were threatened with being in violation of their employment contracts, according to a crew member who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared reprisal. Holland America, which is owned by Carnival Corp., did not return requests for further information. We are aware of reported permission for both Zaandam and Rotterdam to transit the Panama Canal in the near future, the company said in a statement. We greatly appreciate this consideration in the humanitarian interest of our guests and crew. The ship received special authorization from Panamas Ministry of Health and will transit the canal under special considerations and for humanitarian reasons, the canal authority . Crossing the canal will allow the ship to save two travel days, the canal authority added.

President Trump speaking to reporters at the White House on Friday.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times. On Sunday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi put the blame for the nations flawed response to the pandemic squarely on President Trump. His denial at the beginning was deadly, Ms. Pelosi, a California Democrat, said on CNNs State of the Union. Now I think the best thing would be to do is to prevent more loss of life. We really want to work in a unified way to get the job done here, she added, but we cannot continue to allow him to continue to make these underestimates of what is actually happening here. Dont fiddle while people die, Mr. President, Ms. Pelosi said. Hours later, a White House spokesman lashed out at Ms. Pelosis comments, alleging that it was the speaker and the media who had initially refused to acknowledge the severity of the outbreak, and using hyperbolic language to attack her negotiating position on the $2 trillion aid bill Mr. Trump signed on Friday. When she was faced with offering immediate relief to real Americans who are struggling, she blew up negotiations on the coronavirus relief bill with a shameful political attempt to tack radical leftist programs on to the bill, said Hogan Gidley, the spokesman. Democrats did hold up economic stimulus legislation for three days last week while Ms. Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, insisted , including increased oversight for a bailout fund for distressed businesses. As reports of the coronaviruss spread in China began to trickle out, Congress was dealing with Mr. Trumps impeachment trial, but also hosted multiple briefings with administration officials to update lawmakers on the outbreak. Mr. Trump, for his part, has played down the spread of the virus until recently, and has repeatedly touted unproven treatments while contradicting his administrations scientific experts on how lethal the virus is and how quickly it may be contained in the United States. Lawmakers are floating the possibility of another emergency response bill. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, center, at a signing ceremony after the House approved the coronavirus stimulus plan on Friday.Credit...Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times. Over fewer than four weeks, Congress and the White House have agreed to billions of dollars , a significant expansion of the social safety net and , the largest economic response package in modern American history. But lawmakers, administration officials, industry groups and lobbyists are already outlining possible elements of a fourth piece of legislation to combat the spread of the coronavirus and bolster a shuddering economy. We have to pass another bill that goes to meeting the need more substantially than we have, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on CNNs State of the Union on Sunday, ticking off a list of Democratic priorities, including increased protections for workers on the front lines and a further expansion of new paid sick-leave provisions. STIMULUS BILL. Whats in the $2 trillion stimulus? Here are some . Some officials who were involved in the negotiations over the earlier bills, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have cautioned that they may need to see how those laws are implemented before solidifying the components of new legislations. Still, the fourth package could include additional direct payments to taxpayers, as well as more funds for hospitals, states and local governments. If, for whatever reason, this takes longer than we think, we will go back to Congress and get more support for the American economy, Mr. Mnuchin said on Face the Nation on CBS, adding that he hoped such a step was not needed.

Hundreds of thousands of migrant laborers in India have begun long journeys on foot to get home, having been rendered homeless and jobless by the . In different parts of the country, more than a dozen laborers have died during the journeys, hospital officials said early Monday morning. In the capital, Delhi, thousands of migrants, including whole families, packed their pots, pans and blankets into rucksacks, some balancing small children on their shoulders as they walked along interstate highways, in one of the biggest migrations in the countrys recent history. Some planned to walk hundreds of miles. But as they reached the Delhi border, many were beaten back by the police. You fear the disease, living on the streets. But I fear hunger more, not corona, said Papu, 32, who came to Delhi three weeks ago for work and was trying to get to his home in Saharanpur in the state of Uttar Pradesh, 125 miles away. On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi apologized to the country for imposing the nationwide lockdown, which was announced with just four hours notice on Tuesday. So far, 980 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in India, with 24 dead, according to officials. India already had one of the worlds largest homeless populations, and the lockdown may have tripled it overnight, workers for nongovernmental organizations say. A 2011 government census put the number of homeless at 1.7 million, almost certainly a vast underestimate in the country of 1.3 billion. The lockdown, which includes a ban on interstate travel, left Indias enormous migrant population stranded in big cities, where jobs have lured them in vast numbers from the countryside.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The private market, in where the private market is telling us that its a national resource that are then taking our orders apart. Basically, were getting our orders canceled. And thats for PPE. Thats for testing supplies. Thats for testing equipment. So, while were trying to do all the contact tracing, we dont have adequate tests to necessarily do it. We dont have the  along the way, and were not finding markets to be able to do that. Along the way are private suppliers. So we do have to rely on a national chain of distribution or were not going to get it. But we are doing our best to try to do exactly that. Like, Gallatin County would be an example where we have almost half of our overall states those are the positives. Were trying to shift the supply to really isolate that and do the contact tracing, but we just dont have enough supplies to even do the testing. Right.

But governors painted a different picture on the ground. Literally we are one day away, if we dont get test kits from the C.D.C., that we wouldnt be able to do testing in Montana, Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, a Democrat, said, according to an audio recording of the conversation .

The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency approval this weekend permitting the use of two long-used malaria drugs to treat patients who are hospitalized with coronavirus, despite scant evidence that the drugs would be effective against the virus. The decision allows companies to donate supplies of two related drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to the Strategic National Stockpile. The drugs will then be distributed to hospitals for use in patients who have coronavirus. The generic drug maker Sandoz, a division of Novartis, of hydroxychloroquine and Bayer donated one million doses of chloroquine. Other companies are ramping up their production of the drugs and may donate more supplies, the federal government said. it is donating six million pills of hydroxychloroquine to be used in U.S. hospitals. Mr. Trump , describing them as a potential game changer in the pandemic, although there is only anecdotal evidence that they are effective. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and other experts, have been far more cautious in saying that evidence is still needed to know if they work. However, since there are no treatments for the virus, many hospitals are already using the drugs on severely ill patients. The drugs have been on the market for decades and one, hydroxychloroquine, is also used for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The decision by the F.D.A., but announced by the Department of Health and Human Services on Sunday, will allow hospitals to use the drugs on patients when enrolling them in clinical trials is not possible. Doctors must report on how they were used, including documenting any harmful side effects. Patients and doctors will also receive explaining that the drugs efficacy in treating coronavirus is not known. By restricting hospital use of the drugs to those taken from the national stockpile, the move also eases pressure on the rest of the supply chain. Both drugs have recently gone into shortage, making it difficult for patients who rely on them for other conditions to get access. Massachusetts veterans home sees a rash of deaths. Eleven residents of a veterans home in Massachusetts have died, including five people who tested positive for the coronavirus, a state agency announced on Monday, in another example of how the virus can spread in a facility for vulnerable residents.

Austria will require all residents to wear face masks when they shop for groceries starting this week, as a growing number of experts have questioned the prevailing guidance that healthy people dont need to wear masks.

But some experts and government officials . The debate over protective masks for healthy citizens has created tensions as protective gear, including N-95 masks, has been for front-line medical workers, leading officials hoarding and panic-buying by people all over the world.

As the toll of the coronavirus continued to mount overwhelming hospitals and ,, playing and making federal lawmakers and Trump administration officials turned their attention Monday to new measures to try to contain the fallout. In a sign of how fast the virus is upending life in the United States, officials in Washington were already beginning to chart the next phase of the governments response on Monday just days after enacting a $2 trillion stabilization plan, the largest economic stimulus package in modern American history. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said in an interview Monday that state and local government urgently need more resources, and that it was only a matter of time before Congress would act on a fourth relief measure. So this isnt about how fast we can do it, its how fast we must do it, she said. Representative Nydia M. Velasquez, Democrat of New York, announced that she had received a diagnosis of after becoming ill early Sunday morning. Ms. Velasquez, 67, was at the Capitol on Friday, when the House cleared the $2 trillion stimulus law, and later attended a ceremony with senior lawmakers to mark its enrollment. She said her symptoms were mild and the attending physician of the Capitol advised her not to be tested or to see a doctor at the moment.

President Trumps coronavirus briefings have become showcases, not only for himself but for his political supporters and cooperative corporations. On Monday, he turned the podium over to several corporate leaders, including the chief executives of Proctor & Gamble, Jockey International and United Technologies. Among those asked to speak was his friend and political supporter Michael Lindell, founder of Minnesota-based MyPillow Inc. and a member of Mr. Trumps Mar a Lago resort club. Mr. Lindell has called Mr. Trump the greatest president in history. Updated 5m ago. More live coverage: . Mr. Lindell said during his speaking turn in Mondays briefing that, before Mr. Trumps election, the nation had turned its back on God, urging Americans to read Bibles during their extended time at home. I did not know he was going to do that, Mr. Trump said after Mr. Lindells remarks. But he is a friend of mine, and I do appreciate it. Mr. Trump also lashed out at a CNN reporter who asked about his repeated mistaken assurances in recent weeks that the virus would be contained and could go away as early as April. You look at those individual statements, they are all true statements, Mr. Trump told the reporter, Jim Acosta. Mr. Trump suggested that he had been trying to reassure Americans. I could cause panic much better than even you, the president said to Mr. Acosta. I would make you look like a minor-league player. But I dont want to do that.Im very proud. Its almost a miracle the way its all come together, he added. And instead of asking a nasty, snarky question like that, you should ask a real question. CHANGE OF HEART.

But critics say there are few safeguards to ensure that their new authority will not be abused. We could have a parallel epidemic of authoritarian and repressive measures following close if not on the heels of a health epidemic, said Fionnuala Ni Aolain, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights.

Ultra-Orthodox Jews failing to comply with government instructions to contain the coronavirus are causing it to spread so quickly that entire communities to protect the wider population. The virus is mushrooming in ultra-Orthodox communities as much as four to eight times faster than elsewhere in Israel. In the Tel Aviv suburb of Bnei Brak, where 95 percent of the residents are ultra-Orthodox, the number of confirmed cases nearly doubled in the last three days, from 267 on Friday to 508 on Monday. The total was nearly that of Jerusalem, whose population is four times bigger. Experts attribute the proliferation among the ultra-Orthodox to overcrowding and large families, deep distrust of state authority, ignorance of the health risks among religious leaders, an aversion to electronic and secular media and a zealous devotion to a way of life centered on communal activity. All of which add up to stiff resistance to heeding social distancing orders that require people to stay home except for vital errands and prohibit meeting in groups, including for prayer. These rules threaten fundamental activities for the ultra-Orthodox including worship, religious study and the observance of life-cycle events like funerals and weddings. Similar conflicts have arisen in the United States. In Florida, Sheriff Chad Chronister of Hillsborough County said he had for Rev. Rodney Howard-Browne, the pastor of a Pentecostal megachurch, for intentionally and repeatedly defying emergency orders mandating that people maintain social distance and stay at home. Mr. Howard-Browne on Sunday held two church services, each filled with hundreds of parishioners. Roughly three out of four Americans are under orders to stay home, or will be soon.

While many states have issued stay-at-home directives to try to slow the viruss spread with Maryland, Virginia and Arizona becoming the latest to do so on Monday in Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, had resisted the step, favoring local action over statewide mandates. But on Monday Governor DeSantis said that he would sign an order codifying a patchwork of local rules urging residents in the densely-populated southeast corner of the state including Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Monroe counties to stay home. Local Florida governments have taken wildly different approaches to restricting interactions.

FEVER TRACKING. Roughly three out of four Americans are or will soon be under instructions to stay indoors, as states and localities try to curb the spread of the coronavirus before their hospitals are overwhelmed. Virginia and Maryland both issued new statewide orders on Monday, and Arizonas Republican governor, Doug Ducey, directed his states residents to stay home until the end of April. We are no longer asking or suggesting that Marylanders stay home we are directing them to do so, Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican, said. And in Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, ordered all residents to stay home, closing the states beaches and campgrounds and insisting that people only go out for food, supplies, work or medical care.

One inmate used an alcohol pad that a barber had given him after a haircut to sanitize a frequently used Rikers Island jailhouse phone. Another used a sock when he made a call. A third said he and others have used diluted shampoo to disinfect cell bars and table tops. In the nearly two weeks since the coronavirus seeped into New York Citys jail system, fears have grown of in the cellblocks where thousands are being held in close quarters. Public officials have been working to release hundreds of people in jail, but while that effort is moving forward, defense lawyers, elected officials, health experts and even have warned that efforts to release inmates and stop the spread are moving too slowly. Inside the jails, meanwhile, inmates including some of those waiting to be released have been struggling to protect themselves from the virus. Youre on top of one another no matter what you do, said one man who was recently released from Rikers Island. Theres no ventilation. If anything is floating, everybody gets it. As to release their own vulnerable populations in jails and prisons as a result of the coronavirus, New Yorks complex on Rikers Island has provided a case study in the difficulty of balancing public safety and public health concerns. On Sunday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said about 650 people had been released. Still, the rate of infection has continued to climb, and by Monday, 167 inmates, 114 correction staff and 20 health workers had tested positive and two correction staff members had died.

Two months after China brought its economy to a near-halt to contain the coronavirus, the countrys mighty industrial machine is showing signs of renewed life, according to official sources. A measure of factory activity released on Tuesday showed a rebound in March, Chinas National Bureau of Statistics said. The organization, which surveys purchasing managers at Chinese factories, said activity rebounded to 52 on its closely watched index, from 35.7 in February. A number above 50 on the index indicates growing activity, though the figure could overstate the improvement. It does not show to what degree factories have resumed production, meaning those that have opened could still be operating well below capacity. Chinas government has taken a series of top-down measures to get humming again. As the number of new infections reported each day has fallen, local officials have become more confident about allowing people to return to work.

But even if factories and workplaces are back in business, that does not mean the economy is entirely back on its feet. In the epidemics wake, cash-strapped families may be reluctant to spend. Businesses fear that their partners and suppliers might default on payments for goods and services. Demand for Chinese exports may be weak as the epidemic continues to worsen in many countries around the world. Nationwide, major industrial enterprises are operating at an average of 98.6 percent of capacity, said Xin Guobin, Chinas vice minister of industry and information technology, on Monday. And nearly 90 percent of employees at these businesses are back at work. Coronavirus Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak. The virus has infected more than 873,200 people in at least 171 countries.

Struggling to give its a fighting chance to combat a virus that has torn through their own ranks in recent weeks, Spanish officials said on Monday that they would impose even more rigorous restrictions on residents movements, calling for a national period of hibernation. The officials compared the tighter restrictions to those imposed in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus was first detected last year. The measures there were perhaps the most draconian attempted anywhere in the world so far. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez of Spain said at the weekend that the tighter lockdown was needed to avoid the in Madrid and a few other regions of the country.

In emergency rooms and intensive care units throughout New York City, typically dispassionate medical professionals are feeling panicked as increasing numbers of their colleagues get sick. I feel like were all just being sent to slaughter, said Thomas Riley, a nurse at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, who has contracted the virus, along with his husband. Medical workers are still showing up day after day to face overflowing emergency rooms, earning them praise as heroes. But doctors and nurses said they can look overseas for a dark glimpse of the risk they are facing especially when protective gear has been in short supply. The federal government announced Monday that it was for hospitals so they could expand services to fight the pandemic rules including what counts as a hospital bed; how closely certain medical professionals need to be supervised; and what kinds of health care can be delivered at home. These broad but temporary changes will last the length of the national emergency.

Federal authorities are investigating made by Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, in the weeks before Americans began taking seriously the threat of the coronavirus and before markets plummeted, according to reports. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are reviewing a rush of stock sales Mr. Burr made in mid-February that potentially saved him thousands of dollars in losses, and other news outlets reported. The New York Times has not independently confirmed the investigation. Mr. Burr has insisted that he made the sales based purely on public reporting, but as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a member of the Senates Health, Education, Labor and Pensions panel, as it spread in China and then around the world. Investigators would likely work to untangle if any of that information shared with him as a senator prompted his decision. Lawmakers are from relying on nonpublic information to buy or sell stocks, but such cases can be difficult to prove and no one has ever been charged under the 2012 statute outlawing the practice. Mr. Burrs lawyer, Alice Fisher, reiterated on Monday that the senator had only traded based on public information, which is legal. She said he would cooperate with any inquiry into his actions.

I advocate that you work, that everyone works, he said, the newspaper . He repeated his argument that the harm to the economy from efforts to curb its spread can be worse than the pandemic itself. Sometimes, too much medicine becomes poison, he added. Mr. Bolsonaro has called the virus a simple cold and questioned the death toll in Sao Paulo, the countrys largest city. Brazil has recorded 4,256 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 136 deaths as of Sunday. Mr. Lukashenko has also questioned the harm of coronavirus response efforts, saying he endorsed President Trumps comments that the cure to the pandemic cannot be worse than the disease itself. I really like his recent statements, Mr. Lukashenko . He said that unemployment can claim more lives than coronavirus itself unless they reopen businesses and get Americans back to work. Now you have understood why I did not authorize closures of businesses.

The Seattle area, home of the and the place where the virus claimed 37 of its first 50 victims, that harsh containment strategies, imposed in the earliest days of the outbreak, are beginning to pay off at least for now. Deaths are not rising . Significant declines in street traffic show that people are staying home. Hospitals have so far not been overwhelmed. And preliminary statistical models provided to public officials in Washington State suggest that the spread of the virus has slowed in the Seattle area in recent days. While each infected person was spreading the virus to an average of 2.7 other people earlier in March, that number appears to have dropped, with one projection suggesting that it was now down to 1.4. The researchers who are preparing the latest projections, led by the Institute for Disease Modeling, a private research group in Bellevue, Wash., have been watching a variety of data points since the onset of the outbreak. They include tens of thousands of coronavirus test results, deaths and mobility information to estimate the rate at which coronavirus patients are spreading the disease to others. The progress is precarious, and the data, which was still being analyzed and has yet to be published, is uncertain. But the findings offer a measure of hope that in much of the nation can be effective in slowing the spread of the disease. We made a huge impact we slowed the transmission, Seattles mayor, Jenny Durkan, said in an interview. She cautioned that any lifting of restrictions would bring a quick rise in new cases, and that she expected distancing requirements to continue in some form for months. There is evidence that doing the aggressive measures can have a benefit, Gov. Jay Inslee said in an interview, discussing the overall numbers he is seeing. But the governor said that the state was far from turning a corner. While there are indications of improvement, he said, he has also seen numbers in the last few days that still have him worried, including a rise in positive test results statewide and new cases in rural areas.

Chinese companies have and other protective gear to tackle the fast-moving global pandemic. With its own outbreak seemingly under control, it has looked to sell or donate gear to improve its image on the global stage. But some faulty products are showing up in the supply chain, prompting governments in the Netherlands, Turkey and the Philippines to complain. Faulty protective equipment could endanger the lives of health care workers and malfunctioning tests could prevent sick people from getting essential treatment.

Discussion in China is swirling about the true extent of the coronavirus outbreak in the country and the risk of asymptomatic infections. Caixin, an influential Chinese newsmagazine that has aggressively reported on the coronavirus pandemic, that urged the government to disclose the number of asymptomatic infections in the country, a figure that has been kept secret. In Chinas official count of confirmed coronavirus cases, people who ; they are added to the tally only if they start to feel sick. came after confirmation of a case on Sunday in Henan Province, who apparently was infected by a person who did not show symptoms and was not counted in the official tally released to the public. The Caixin commentary said revealing the scale and spread of asymptomatic cases was important for research and informing the public of continuing possible risks. China has reported outside those brought in from overseas. The case reported in Henan on Sunday suggests that the virus continues to spread among people who might not be included in the public tally. Observers have also scrutinized the countrys death toll. Caixin reported last week that thousands of urns were sent to funeral homes in Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, in recent days, raising questions about whether the death toll in the city could be higher than the official figure of 2,547.

Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne who was quarantined in Scotland over the last seven days , has taken himself out of isolation, Buckingham Palace announced on Monday. The prince is in good health, an official at the palace said. He is now operating under the current standard medical restrictions that apply nationwide. The prince, who is 71, began suffering mild symptoms the weekend of March 21 and was tested in Scotland on March 23. The palace said that Charles would be able to hold meetings and to exercise and that his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, would remain in isolation until the end of the week. She did not test positive for the virus, the palace said last week, but she is being monitored. Britains guidance indicates that those who test positive for the virus should stay at home for seven days after symptoms begin, but the World Health Organization recommends that confirmed patients remain isolated for two weeks after symptoms resolve. The top levels of the British government suffered another shock on Monday when Dominic Cummings, the top adviser to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, reported that he had symptoms of the virus and had isolated himself, according to the government. Mr. Cummings was seen on Friday , the prime ministers official residence, with a backpack, shortly after Mr. Johnson . Mr. Cummings is the latest high-ranking official directly involved in Britains outbreak response who is suspected to have contracted the virus.

Mr. Johnson posted a video on Twitter on Sunday , appearing in a suit and tie but with a noticeably hoarse voice. He thanked those health care workers who were coming back into the National Health Service, or N.H.S., in such huge numbers.

This is battlefield medicine, Mr. de Blasio said. Get us the support we need right now. President Trump, during an appearance on Fox & Friends on Monday morning, repeated praise for what his administration had done so far. Were delivering so much equipment, nobody has ever seen anything like it. Its a war, Mr. Trump said. Were fighting a war and the federal government is really stepped up and most governors are very happy. Mr. Trump acknowledged , but said that the federal government was loading it up with lifesaving equipment. New York is really in trouble, he said. But I think its going to end up being fine. Even as become flooded with coronavirus cases, some patients were being left behind in their homes because the health care system cannot handle them all, according to dozens of interviews with paramedics, New York Fire Department officials and union representatives, as well as city data. In a matter of days, for medical distress apparently related to the virus. Typically, the system sees about 4,000 Emergency Medical Services calls a day. Last Thursday, dispatchers took more than 7,000 calls a volume not seen since the Sept. 11,2001, terrorist attacks. The record for the number of calls in a day was broken three times in the last week. Phil Suarez, a paramedic, was dispatched to two homes in the Washington Heights neighborhood, where entire families in cramped apartments appeared to be stricken with the virus. Im terrified, said Mr. Suarez, who has been a paramedic in New York City for 26 years, assisted in rescue efforts during the Sept. 11 attacks and later served in the Iraq war. I honestly dont know if Im going to survive. Im terrified of what Ive already possibly brought home. NEW YORKS OUTBREAK. The citys . The virus threatens to wipe out half of all jobs in Africa. Outside a supermarket in Johannesburg on Friday.Credit...Marco Longari/Agence France-Presse Getty Images. Nearly half of all jobs in Africa could be lost because of the coronavirus, according to the United Nations. In a report released on Monday, the world body warned that the crisis would disproportionately affect developing countries in Africa and elsewhere, taking a toll on education, human rights, basic food security and nutrition. This pandemic is a health crisis. But not just a health crisis. For vast swathes of the globe, the pandemic will leave deep, deep scars, Achim Steiner, the administrator of the United Nations Development Program, which produced the report, said in a statement. Without support from the international community, we risk a massive reversal of gains made over the last two decades, and an entire generation lost, if not in lives, then in rights, opportunities and dignity. Among the developing nations named in the report were Bosnia, China, Djibouti, El Salvador, Eritrea, Iran, Kyrgyzstan, Madagascar, Nigeria, Paraguay, Panama, Serbia, Ukraine and Vietnam. Overpopulation, poor waste management, pollution and traffic were all identified as factors that threatened a developing nations chances of recovering from a coronavirus outbreak.

After an outbreak, the Marine Corps stops sending new recruits to its boot camp at Parris Island, S.C. The Marine Corps has stopped sending new recruits to its boot camp at Parris Island, S.C., for the foreseeable future after a coronavirus outbreak there infected more than 20 recruits. The incident at Parris Island, one of the Corps two training depots, is serious for the Marine Corps. As the smallest branch in the military, with around 185,000 people, and a high turnover rate , stopping the supply of new recruits, even temporarily, will have long-lasting effects, Marine officials have said in the past. The spike in cases, said Capt. Bryan McDonnell, a spokesman for Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, is believed to have started with two recruits who were brought on for training and quickly infected others. Until Monday, new recruits were screened upon their arrival, so, Captain McDonnell said, it is believed the two were asymptomatic. They have since been quarantined. Basic training has continued in the other military branches, with an increased emphasis on screening and testing before training begins. But shared living spaces, communal showers and close contact in recruit barracks nearly ensures that any outbreak of the virus will mushroom in days. In a statement Monday, the Marine Corps said that the move to stop sending recruits to Parris Island was out of an abundance of caution and that recruit training for individuals already at the Depot will continue as planned," with continued emphasis on personal and environmental cleanliness and social distancing.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Models predicting expected spread of the virus in the U.S. paint a grim picture. The top government scientists battling the coronavirus estimated Tuesday that the deadly pathogen could kill between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans, in spite of the social distancing measures that have closed schools, banned large gatherings, limited travel and forced people to stay in their homes. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nations leading infectious disease expert, and Dr. Deborah L. Birx, who is coordinating the coronavirus response, displayed that grim projection at the White House on Tuesday, calling it our real number but pledging to do everything possible to reduce those numbers even further. The conclusions generally match those from similar models by public health researchers around the globe. As dire as those predictions are, Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx said the number of deaths could be much higher if Americans do not follow the strict guidelines to keep the virus from spreading, and they urged people to take the restrictions seriously. Unlock more free articles. President Trump, who on Sunday extended for 30 days the governments recommendations for slowing the spread of the virus, made it clear that the data compiled by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx convinced him that the death toll would be even higher if the restrictions on work, school, travel and social life were not taken seriously by all Americans. The data released on Tuesday was the first time that Mr. Trumps administration has officially estimated the breadth of the threat to human life from the coronavirus, and the disease it brings, known as Covid-19. In the past several weeks, Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci have resisted predicting how many people might die in the pandemic, saying that there was not enough reliable data. That is no longer the case, they said. As of Tuesday afternoon, at least 173,741 people across every state, plus Washington, D.C., and four U.S. territories, have tested positive for the virus, according to a New York Times database. At least 3,433 patients with the virus have died. TRACKING THE OUTBREAK. The New York Times is sharing .

They projected that Covid-19 could kill up to 240,000 Americans, but pledged to do everything possible to reduce that number.CreditCredit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times. President Trump said at his daily White House coronavirus briefing that this is going to be a very painful, very very painful two weeks, but that Americans will soon start seeing some real light at the end of the tunnel. I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead. Were going through a very tough few weeks, Mr. Trump said, later raising his two weeks to three. Striking perhaps his most somber tone on the subject to date, Mr. Trump said the virus is a great national trial unlike any we have ever faced before, and said it would require the full absolute measure of our collective strength, love and devotion in order to minimize the number of people infected. Its a matter of life and death, frankly, he said, officially calling for another month of social distancing and offering a sober assessment of the pandemics impact in the United States. Its a matter of life and death. Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White Houses coronavirus response coordinator, urged Americans to follow the guidelines: no groups larger than 10 people, no unnecessary travel, no going to restaurants or bars. Theres no magic bullet, theres no magic vaccine, she said. Its just behaviors. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that social distancing measures across the nation are slowing the spread of the virus, but he made clear that the national death toll will continue to rise. The 15 days that weve had of mitigation clearly are having an effect, Dr. Fauci said. But, he added: In the next several days to a week or so we are going to continue to see things go up. Mr. Trump, who spent weeks downplaying the threat of the virus and who has retreated from his recent suggestion that social distancing could be scaled back in mid-April congratulated himself for projections showing that public health measures may dramatically limit the national death toll. What would have happened if we did nothing? Because there was a group that said, Lets just ride it out, Mr. Trump said, without saying what group he was referring to. Mr. Trump said that as many as 2.2 million people would have died if we did nothing, if we just carried on with our life. You would have seen people dying on airplanes, you would have seen people dying in hotel lobbies you would have seen death all over, Mr. Trump said. By comparison, he said, a potential death toll of 100,000 is a very low number. Asked how current casualty estimates might differ had Mr. Trump called for social distancing measures weeks earlier than he did, in mid-March, almost two months after the first confirmed case of coronavirus in the United States, Mr. Trump insisted that he had acted decisively. I think weve done a great job, Mr. Trump said. Asked about his repeated assurances to Americans in recent weeks that the virus would peter out with minimal impact, Mr. Trump insisted, as he has before, that he was trying to reassure the nation. I want to be positive; I dont want to be negative, Mr. Trump said. I want to give people in this country hope. Were going through probably the worst thing the countrys ever seen, he added. We lose more here potentially than you lose in world wars as a country. As many as 25 percent of people infected with the new coronavirus may not show symptoms. The high level of symptom-free cases is leading the C.D.C. to consider broadening its guidelines on who should wear masks.Credit...Marian Carrasquero for The New York Times. A startlingly high number of people infected with the new coronavirus may not show symptoms, , complicating efforts to predict the pandemics course and strategies to mitigate its spread. In particular, the high level of symptom-free cases is leading the C.D.C. to consider broadening its guidelines on who should wear masks. This helps explain how rapidly this virus continues to spread across the country, the director, Dr. Robert Redfield, told National Public Radio broadcast on Tuesday. The agency has repeatedly said that ordinary citizens do not need to wear masks unless they are feeling sick. But with the new data on people who may be infected without ever feeling sick, or who are transmitting the virus for a couple of days before feeling ill, Mr. Redfield said that such guidance was being critically re-reviewed. MASKS. The advice from public health officials has been confusing, leaving us to decide whether a D.I.Y. mask is better than nothing. Should I Make My Own Mask?. March 31, 2020. Researchers do not know precisely how many people are infected without feeling ill, or if some of them are simply presymptomatic. But since the new coronavirus surfaced in December, researchers have spotted unsettling anecdotes of apparently healthy people who were unwitting spreaders. Patient Z, for example, a 26-year-old man in Guangdong, China, was a infected with the coronavirus in February. But he felt no signs of anything amiss, not on Day 7 after the contact, nor on Day 10 or 11. Already by Day 7, though, the virus had bloomed in his nose and throat, just as copiously as in those who did become ill. Patient Z might have felt fine, but he was infected just the same. Researchers now say that people like Patient Z are not . For example, as many as 18 percent of people infected with the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship never developed symptoms, according to one analysis. A team in Hong Kong suggests that from 20 to 40 percent of transmissions in China occurred before symptoms appeared. The high level of covert spread may help explain why the novel coronavirus is the first virus that is not an influenza virus to set off a pandemic. WHEN TO WEAR A MASK.

Many European countries have imposed various forms of lockdowns to contain the epidemic, but Igualada, an industrial town 30 miles northwest of Barcelona, stands out. Even as Spain has , it has cut Igualada off from the rest of the country a lockdown within a lockdown. After its hospital was identified as a hub of a regional outbreak that has reached nearly 20,000 coronavirus infections and more than 2,500 deaths, officials sealed off Igualada and three smaller neighboring towns, at midnight on March 12, stranding about 65,000 people. Police forces guard every access point, allowing only essential workers to enter and leave. The barriers have divided families like Ms. Rodriguezs, put people out of work and thrown households into uncertainty for weeks, if not more.

By the hundreds of thousands, Americans are asking for help for the first time in their lives, from nail technicians in Los Angeles to airport workers in Fort Lauderdale, from bartenders in Phoenix to former reality show contestants in Minnesota.

Its casinos are deserted and thousands of hotel rooms are empty. But when Las Vegas, gripped by the coronavirus, needed space for a temporary homeless shelter, officials chose a location that does not have walls, or even a roof: an outdoor parking lot. The City of Las Vegas and Clarke County opened the temporary shelter, located on the upper floor of a convention center parking lot, after a 500-person shelter run by Catholic Charities was closed after a homeless man there tested positive for Covid-19. Medical students from Touro University, wearing protective gear, have been tasked with screening each person for symptoms before they enter the parking area, which has been partly covered with blue mats and closed off by metal barriers. The shelter will remain open until April 3, when the Catholic Charities facility is expected to reopen, according to a statement by the city and county. More than 6,500 Las Vegas residents lack permanent housing and nearly 70 percent of the citys homeless population sleeps outside, according to the Las Vegas government. With a nearby shelter overflowing, officials decided to expand into the parking lot, at the Cashman Center convention complex about seven miles from the Las Vegas Strip. Volunteers laid out 24,000 square feet of carpet for the homeless to use as sleeping mats, which have been spaced six feet apart to abide by social distancing protocols, said David Riggleman, a spokesman for the City of Las Vegas.

American companies are reeling from the body blow dealt by the pandemic. As revenues dwindle, travel slows and production lines halt, companies have begun to furlough or lay off employees, slash investment in operations and buy less from their suppliers. With no way to tell when the economy will restart, they are racing to conserve money and tap as much credit as possible. The new reality, say bankers and analysts, will be tough for companies that had grown accustomed to the easy money of the past decade. Enticed by ultralow interest rates, they borrowed trillions of dollars in new debt in the belief that banks would keep lending and the debt markets would always be open. Now many indebted companies, even those whose business has not taken a direct hit from the outbreak, are finding that they have to adapt to an era in which cash is suddenly much harder to raise. Carlos Hernandez, the chairman of JPMorgan Chases investment banking business, recently told clients and colleagues that the economic shutdown caused by the pandemic could prompt the sort of brutal reckoning for corporate America that banks went through after the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Hernandez, from his perch at the nations biggest lender, is seeing the potential crisis unfold firsthand, as his bank and others get bombarded with loan requests from companies stocking up on cash. Banks are still lending, but these are bloodcurdling times for corporations. Already, a divide among haves and have-nots is emerging in corporate America, tied to how cheaply and easily companies can get credit. Seeing this, Congress moved quickly in recent legislation to funnel emergency loans into the United States economy. Still, some types of companies could be shut out entirely from a multitrillion-dollar loan program lawmakers just set up, unless the Federal Reserve relaxes its own rules. CREDIT CRUNCH.

Japan has barred visitors from most of Europe and is considering denying entry to travelers from other countries, including the United States.Credit...Noriko Hayashi for The New York Times. Across Asia, countries and cities that seemed to have brought the epidemic under control are suddenly tightening their borders and imposing stricter containment measures, fearful about a wave of new infections imported from elsewhere. The moves portend a worrisome sign for the United States, Europe and the rest of the world still battling a surging outbreak: Any countrys success with containment could be tenuous, and the world could remain on a kind of indefinite lockdown. Even when the number of new cases starts to fall, travel barriers and bans in many places may persist until a vaccine or treatment is found. The risk otherwise is that the infection could be reintroduced inside their borders, especially given the prevalence of asymptomatic people who might unknowingly carry the virus with them. Following a recent uptick in cases tied to international travelers, China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan barred foreigners from entering altogether in recent days. Japan has from most of Europe, and is considering denying entry to travelers from countries including the United States. South Korea imposed stricter controls, requiring incoming foreigners to quarantine in government facilities for 14 days upon arrival. In China, international flights have been cut back so severely that Chinese students abroad wonder when they will be able to get home. In Singapore, recently returned citizens must share their phones location data with the authorities each day to prove they are sticking to government-ordered quarantines. In Taiwan, a man who had traveled to Southeast Asia was fined $33,000 for sneaking out to a club when he was supposed to be on lockdown at home. Even countries that have been relatively successful in managing the pandemic are only as safe as the weakest links in the system, said Kristi Govella, an assistant professor of Asian studies at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, who added that in the absence of cooperation among countries, closing borders is one of the ways that individual governments can control the situation. AFTER THE CURVE FLATTENS. Why Asias new coronavirus controls . British doctors have been reassured they wont be held liable if theres a shortage of ventilators. A British association of intensive care doctors has reassured its members that denying life-sustaining care to a critically ill coronavirus patient because of a shortage of ventilators will not expose doctors to legal liability. A released Tuesday night reflects the rising anxiety of British doctors as the soaring number of coronavirus patients requiring respiratory support threatens to exceed the limited number of available ventilators. Some doctors facing the same situation in Italy have said they denied care to those deemed relatively less likely to survive. This week, several London doctors said they feared their hospitals might soon face similar choices. These are extraordinary times, the association said in the statement. Even if a doctor considered certain treatment might help a patient but such treatment was simply not available perhaps because there were no ventilators available in that hospital or any other reasonably and realistically proximate hospital the doctor cannot be found at fault for not providing such treatment. It was simply not possible. A new law, the Coronavirus Act, will provide additional protection. It indemnifies doctors for negligence liabilities arising from activities carried out for the purpose of dealing with, or because of, the coronavirus outbreak, the statement said. The Intensive Care Society warned doctors, however, that they must not deliberately intervene and provide treatment that would actively bring about a patients death. That would be euthanasia and is illegal. Even as New Yorks numbers soar, those who cant afford to quarantine must brave the subway. 0:00/1:50.

I dont want to get sick, I dont want my family to get sick, but I still need to get to my job, Yolanda Encancion, a home health aide, said recently as she waited for her train in the Bronx. Since the crisis erupted, the subways have emptied: Ridership has plummeted to fewer than 1 million riders a day from more than five million before. But a New York Times analysis of M.T.A. data shows that the declines vary significantly largely along socioeconomic lines. The steepest ridership declines have been in Manhattan, where the median household income is the highest in the city. Some stations in Bronx neighborhoods with high poverty rates, though, have largely retained their ridership. Many residents there say they have no choice but to pile onto trains with strangers, potentially exposing themselves to the virus. Even worse, a reduction in service in response to plunging ridership has led, at times, to crowded conditions, making it impossible to maintain the social distancing that public health experts recommend. According to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the number of confirmed cases in New York increased by 9,298, bringing the statewide total to 75,795 statewide as of Tuesday. In New York City, 43,139 people have tested positive. The number of patients hospitalized surpassed 10,900, up 15 percent from yesterday. Of those, 2,710 are currently in intensive care rooms with ventilators.

And then find out two hours later, Oh, they have that virus. And Ive already been exposed. Nursing Assistants, CNAs, were the closest ones, were the front line. The work of nursing assistants has always been difficult and low paying. But add coronavirus, and its become dangerous. TV announcers: Across the country, nursing homes are especially vulnerable One elder care facility, where 19 residents have died In Palo Alto In the New Orleans area In DuPage County In Sacramento County. Covid-19 spreading through our most vulnerable population. We met up with caregivers from nursing homes in Northern California. They attend to the kind of patients who are most likely to die if they get the virus. So can you do your job without touching people, or without Its impossible. Everything is touch. Bathing. Feeding. Assist them to the restroom. Brushing their teeth. Turning. Its almost like a holding and cleaning at the same time. Helping nurses with wound care. Cleaning their ears, tying their shoes. We do everything. Well, you could be feeding that patient or you could be doing something and the patient starts coughing. Its too late to turn around, you already done got crap all over you. You know, you just run to the bathroom, wash your face or whatever. And then go about your day. Social distance? Cant do it. Its impossible. If this video were filmed at a different time, youd be seeing footage of these workers with their patients. But nursing homes are closed to visitors right now to protect the people inside. Actually everything youre seeing here we filmed from afar, following recommendations to slow the spread of Covid-19. But these caregivers cant maintain that kind of distance in their work. And now, shortages of protective gear like masks are putting them at risk, not just for getting the virus but for spreading it. If you want to speak, press star 6. Were running out of supplies of masks in our building. And trying to take care of these patients without us also getting sick is worrisome. Were rationing right now, masks, protective gear. But its like, what happens if we run out? It scares me. They gave us the N95 mask, and told us to maintain it. If the elastic comes off by accident or something, staple and reuse it. So youre actually cleaning the N95 masks in between uses? Yeah, with with alcohol. You like wipe off the outside of it or how do you do that? The outside, the inside and just let it air dry, and put it back in a Ziploc bag for the next day. A lot of people in this field, we have families. So you dont want to take nothing home. My granddaughter, shes special needs. So she has a low immune system. When she was born, she was really sick. So weve been cautious ever since shes been born. I am very concerned of taking it home. My mom, shes diabetic, and my dad also just beat cancer in the thyroid. I have asthma. So if I were to get Covid, It would affect my lungs. And how am I going to pay my bills? Because its paycheck to paycheck, what Im doing. The pay for this work is low: In the U.S., the median salary is less than $30,000 a year. As a result, many nursing assistants work multiple jobs. And as they move between facilities, so can disease. Usually when I finish the first job, I go right to the second job. I work 16 hours, thats not including driving time. And Im not the only one majority of my co-workers, they work two jobs. I work home health care too, on top of taking care of my mom and my grandmother. Im kind of worried because you dont see the virus because theyre droplets, and you dont know whos coughing or sneezing on you. Even though I do try to sanitize, like along the way, going to my next client. But sometimes its just not enough I think.

Its strenuous work and the pay is low: The national median salary is less than $30,000. Many nursing assistants live paycheck to paycheck and work second, or even third jobs. Now, with the coronavirus pandemic, this work has also become high risk. Jeffrey Ravago, a nursing assistant who lives in Vallejo, Calif., said that a lack of masks puts workers at risk. Cynthia Yee, who works in long-term care in San Francisco, told us that her facility issued her one N95 mask, and instructed her to clean it with rubbing alcohol. They told her, if the elastic comes off by accident, staple and reuse it, she said. The Trump administration had invoked the Defense Production Act hundreds of thousands of times, but hesitated when the virus hit.

 the president to use the law to force the production of ventilators and other medical equipment to combat , he has for weeks treated it like a last resort, to be invoked only when all else fails. You know, were a country not based on nationalizing our business, Mr. Trump said earlier this month. The laws frequent use, especially by the military to give its contracts priority ratings to jump ahead of a vendors other clients, has prompted those most familiar with it to question why the administration has been so hesitant to tap it for a public health emergency. Whats more important? Building an aircraft carrier or a frigate using priority ratings or saving a hundred thousand lives using priorities for ventilators? said Larry Hall, who retired in August as the director of the Defense Production Act program division at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. EQUIPMENT SHORTAGES. The when the pandemic hit. Afghans meet coronavirus with kindness. A tailor, Mohammad Younas, distributing some of the 8,000 masks he has made to residents in Kandahar, Afghanistan. In a moment of need, ordinary Afghans have stepped up to generously share the little that they have, easing the pain of an impending health crisis that is turning into another test of survival for a country where life has been a daily fight for decades. Across Afghanistan, many landlords have waived rent, in some cases indefinitely until the virus threat recedes. Tailors have handed out thousands of homemade face masks. Youth groups and athletes have delivered food to hospitals and families in destitution. Wedding halls and private schools have volunteered to be turned into hospitals. The owner of a marketplace of 40 shops forgave rent not just for the month, but for as long as the epidemic continues. The governor of one province set up an emergency Covid-19 fund and in just one day received contributions of more than $100,000. Mohamed Kareem Tawain, an 80-year-old dentist in Herat, the center of the outbreak in Afghanistan, said that he had experienced multiple wars and droughts in his lifetime, and that Afghanistan was better prepared to deal with the virus than those past scourges. I am not too terrified, he said. Although it is difficult times, if we join hands, God willing, the corona problem will pass. HELPING NEIGHBORS.

A doctor leading Russias fight against the virus and who shook hands with President Vladimir V. Putin at a meeting last week has tested positive. Denis Protsenko, the head doctor at Hospital No. 40, Moscows main and most modern infectious diseases treatment facility, on Tuesday that he had gone into self-isolation in his office at the hospital, which Mr. Putin visited last Tuesday. He said he was feeling quite well and would continue working remotely. Dr. Protsenko had greeted the president with a handshake, and neither man wore a face mask. Mr. Putin donned a protective suit and gas mask to visits wards containing virus patients, but also had extensive unprotected contact with the doctors and nurses. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, responding to news of Dr. Protsenkos infection, said that Mr. Putin had been tested regularly for coronavirus and that everything is OK, the Interfax news agency reported. Russia on Tuesday reported 500 new confirmed cases, bringing its total to 2,337, a nearly fivefold increase over a week ago, with 17 deaths. Europe debates using cellphone data to combat the virus without compromising privacy. A public square in central Berlin on Saturday.Credit...Emile Ducke for The New York Times. Tracking the movements of infected people is critical for stemming the spread of disease. And at a time when cellphones are a powerful personal tracking tool, it is not surprising that governments want to harness that potential to aid in the fight against the coronavirus. But in the European Union, which has , using such technology is a complicated and thorny issue. That friction is coming to the fore in Germany, where the that would allow the authorities to quickly alert anyone who may have come into contact with someone who is found to have been infected. As researchers across Europe scramble to develop an app that would respect personal privacy while still helping track the virus, Germanys justice minister, Christine Lambrecht, said on Tuesday that the government could not require people to use such technology. Voluntary use is a very important aspect here, she . We will not and we do not want to get around that. Digital tracking measures have been credited with keeping public life going in and , while still limiting the spread of the virus. In Europe, Poland is using an app to track the movements of an estimated 10,000 people who are under home quarantine because they either tested positive for coronavirus or recently returned from abroad. Users are required to upload selfies several times a day to prove that they are following the rules of self-isolation, and any lapse in compliance results in an alert being sent to the police. In Croatia, rights groups are pushing back against proposed legislation to monitor cellphones, saying that it would be an unnecessary violation of human rights. Germanys health minister has called for a nationwide debate about the ethics of using such technology. Polls have shown an increasing willingness among Germans to rely on digital technology to combat the spread of the virus, in exchange for a return to more personal freedom. E.U. countries send medical supplies to Iran. A temporary coronavirus hospital in Tehran on Thursday.Credit...Arash Khamooshi for The New York Times. More than a year after France, Germany and Britain said to work around U.S. sanctions against Iran, they have sent a first shipment of medical goods to the coronavirus-ravaged country, . The statement said that the trade mechanism, known as Instex, and its Iranian counterpart would continue to work on further transactions and deliveries of humanitarian goods, which are not forbidden by United States sanctions. The United States reimposed harsh sanctions on Iran in 2018 when Mr. Trump pulled out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. It became almost impossible for European companies to continue trading with Iran because of secondary sanctions that forbid any such trade using the American banking system. Instex was as a kind of barter system to allow Europeans to buy Iranian oil and gas in exchange for European products. Because few European countries were willing to risk American sanctions, however, the system has been limited to items like pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. This month, the three European countries, all signatories to the Iran nuclear deal and eager to try to maintain it, offered Iran an aid package valued at 5 million euros, nearly $5.5 million, to help fight the coronavirus. Iran had over 41,495 s and 2,757 deaths as of Tuesday. A U.S. judge orders the release of some immigration detainees. A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that more than a dozen people must be released from federal immigration detention facilities in Pennsylvania by the end of the day, because the detainees age or pre-existing health conditions put them at high risk of contracting the virus in the facilities. Two of the plaintiffs were already showing symptoms, their lawyers said, but had not been tested for it. According to their legal complaint, the plaintiffs have been sleeping two or three to a small cell, or side-by-side in bigger rooms of more than 50, with bunk beds so close that they could bump into each other during the night. They ate shoulder to shoulder and had 60 people sharing four showers and four sinks with little sanitization in between uses, said Vic Walczak, the legal director of the Pennsylvania chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the plaintiffs. If you have one infected person in that room, those kind of conditions are only going to guarantee that everybody else is going to be infected. The complainants in the case who are from countries including Nigeria, Indonesia, Guatemala and India were at especially high risk because of high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, heart stents and other chronic conditions. In ordering their release, Judge John E. Jones III of the Federal District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania wrote, Our world has been altered with lightning speed, and the results are both unprecedented and ghastly. He continued, The choices we now make must reflect this new reality. Kenyan police are accused of abuses as they enforce a curfew.

The authorities in Kenya are investigating a string of deaths and injuries related to the enforcement of a nationwide dusk-to-dawn curfew, one of several wide-ranging measures aimed at containing the spread of the virus in the country. The office of the director of public prosecutions announced on Tuesday that an investigation into the killing of Yasin Moyo, a 13-year-old boy who was hit by a stray bullet and died of his injuries on Monday night as officers enforced the curfew in a neighborhood on the outskirts of Nairobi, the capital. The inspector general of Kenyas police force said investigators to undertake a forensic analysis of all firearms held by officers who were on duty in the area at time of the shooting. The case is the latest to rock the East African nation since an overnight curfew was introduced on Friday. Hours before it began, images and videos shared on social media firing tear gas and beating and detaining commuters at a ferry terminal in the coastal city of Mombasa. On Tuesday, the government-mandated Independent Police Oversight Authority it would investigate the incident, along with other reports of excessive use of force by police. The 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew is among a raft of new policies aimed at halting the virus. Officials have also closed schools and universities, banned religious gatherings and suspended international flights. Kenya had 59 confirmed cases of the virus on Tuesday, and at least one death. Police officials in Britain and elsewhere are also enforcing restrictions on movement and have sometimes been accused of overreach. There is a strong temptation for the police to lose sight of their real functions and turn themselves from citizens in uniform into glorified school prefects, Jonathan Sumption, a former Supreme Court judge, on Monday. In France, more than a quarter of a million people have been fined since restrictions on movement were announced, according to Interior Ministry figures. And in Italy, the , anyone violating quarantine rules can be fined up to 3,000 euros, about $3,300. Seeing the pandemic test Trump, Democrats offer up their own policy ideas. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont during a Democratic debate in Washington earlier this month.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont share a number of priorities regarding the outbreak. Both have been sharply critical of Mr. Trumps stewardship of the crisis. They have called on him to move to accelerate the production of critical medical gear for health care workers. They have urged him to listen to expert advice from scientists. And they have also expressed concerns about the economic impact of the outbreak, with both seeking housing-related protections for the public. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have both urged a moratorium on evictions and support temporary rent freezes. There are also key differences between how they have navigated the crisis. For Mr. Sanders, the outbreak has offered another reason to push for his signature single-payer health care proposal, Medicare for all, which Mr. Biden opposes. that the moment has revealed extraordinary weaknesses in the American public health system and underscored the need for universal health care. Mr. Biden, who supports building on the Affordable Care Act with the addition of a public option, has sought to use the crisis to illustrate as president, rolling out a public health advisory committee and spending hours receiving briefings focused on the virus and on the economy. Yet despite ramping up his news media appearances and virtual events, Mr. Biden the front-runner for the Democratic nomination has sometimes found himself .

The United States coronavirus death toll has moved past Chinas official count, a bleak milestone hours before the Trump administration planned to release the models that fueled fears that as many as 200,000 Americans could die because of the pandemic. Although the count from mainland China 3,305 deaths has been a subject of intense skepticism, and although Italy and Spain have reported more than 20,000 fatalities between them, the swelling toll in the United States is a grim indication of the outbreaks scale. The U.S., despite widespread concerns about , already had the highest known number of infections in the world, and the American toll was at least 3,430 deaths, as of late Tuesday morning. But there are mounting concerns that some countries, including China, North Korea and Indonesia, are not being forthcoming about the scope of their outbreaks. China on Tuesday announced more than 1,500 coronavirus cases that had not previously been made public, giving in to pressure for greater transparency nearly two weeks after officials there first announced . Questions about the accuracy of Chinas numbers have , even as the country has touted its apparent success in bringing it under control. The 1,541 newly announced cases were people who had tested positive but were asymptomatic, according to an official at Chinas National Health Commission. China had not previously included asymptomatic patients in its public tallies of confirmed cases, even though the World Health Organization recommends doing so, and many within China and abroad had expressed fear about the true scale of the epidemic.
