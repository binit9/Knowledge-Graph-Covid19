About mortuary care and post-mortem examination, WHO recommends packing and transporting a body with acute respiratory infection to a morgue, crematorium or burial by ensuring it is fully sealed in an impermeable body bag before being removed from the isolation area to avoid leakage of body fluid. When properly packed in a body bag, the body can be safely removed for storage in the mortuary, sent to the crematorium, or placed in a coffin for burial, it said. The global health body advises using personal protective equipment such as disposable, long-sleeved, cuffed gowns for handling bodies; if the outside of the body is visibly contaminated with body fluids, excretions, or secretions, it has to be ensured that the gown is waterproof. It further recommends that mortuary staff and burial team apply standard precautions like proper hand hygiene and use appropriate personal protective equipment, including facial protection, if there is a risk of splashes from the patients body fluids or secretions onto the body or face of the staff member. Transmission of lethal infectious diseases associated with mortuary care has been reported.. manage each situation on a case-by-case basis, balancing the rights of the family with the risks of exposure to infection, WHO said. 6 P.M.

Cash reserves are running down quickly as fleets are grounded and what flights there are operate much less than half full, it added. Forward bookings are far outweighed by cancellations and each time there is a new government recommendation it is to discourage flying. Demand is drying up in ways that are completely unprecedented. Normality is not yet on the horizon, it said. CAPA said the failure to coordinate the future will result in protectionism and much less competition. The alternative does not bear thinking about. An unstructured and nationalistic outcome will not be survival of the fittest. It will mostly consist of airlines that are the biggest and the best-supported by their governments. The system will reek of nationalism. And it will not serve the needs of the 21st century world. That is not a prospect that any responsible government should be prepared to contemplate, the consultancy firm said. - PTI. TAMIL NADU. Chennais protests in Old Washermanpet temporarily suspended.

Highlights from PM Modi's address to the nation on coronavirus:. Normally when a natural disaster or political crisis occurs it is restricted to some countries, but this time it has engulfed the whole world. Even WW-I and WW-II did not involve as many countries as Coronavirus has done. India has, for the last two months, tried to combat the disease. But for the last few days an atmosphere is being created that we are somehow safe. This is not the right way to think. Every Indian requires to be alert and take precautions. Friends, you have never disappointed me whenever I have asked you for something. Today, I ask 130 crore Indians I want your next few weeks. My dear countrymen, till now science has not alighted on a confirmed treatment or vaccine to combat Coronavirus. It is therefore natural to be worried. Narendra Modi. @narendramodi. My address to the nation.  Narendra Modi @narendramodi. My address to the nation. #IndiaFightsCorona. pscp.tv. 109K. 45.4K people are talking about this.  In countries where the disease has spread widely, a specific thing has been seen. There has been an explosive rise in the cases after a trough. The Government of India is carefully watching these trends. There are some countries which have managed to combat this to an extent, and we have seen that it has been done with the active cooperation of its citizens. For our country, which is developing one, it is a big challenge. To combat it two important things are required One is Sankalp (resolution) and Sayyam (patience). As citizens, we must resolve that we will perform our duty and follow the directions of the Central government that we will avoid being infected and save others from being infected. When there is no medicine for this disease then prevention is important. If we are healthy, others will be too. We can do this by avoiding gatherings, what is being called social distancing. In these times, this social distancing is important. If you feel that you are well or that nothing will happen to you by roaming around in markets, it is not correct. You will be doing an injustice to yourself and to your family and fellow countrymen. For the next few weeks please do not venture out without any pressing need. Those who work in government, hospitals, media etc. may not be able to avoid it, but the rest should. I request senior citizens, those above 60-65 years of age, please do not venture out of your homes. When I was a child, when war used to be declared, villages upon villages used to undergo blackouts. Therefore Im asking countrymen to impose a Janata Curfew a self-imposed, self-regulated curfew. On March 22, this Sunday, from morning 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. this Janata Curfew should be undertaken. Those attached to essential services, they may need to venture out. This attempt on March 22, will be a demonstration of our resolve to take on the challenge of this disease. I request State governments also to help implement this. There are many civil society bodies, I request them to also help in this endeavour of Janata Curfew. You can call 10 new people in a day and discuss this. This Janata Curfew will be like a crucible for us to test whether India is ready to deal with coronavirus. I want another bit of cooperation from you on March 22, for the last two months many of our people working at hospitals, police departments, rail and airport staff have been working to serve others without caring for themselves. This is not an ordinary service as they run the risk of being infected. They are a bulwark between us and coronavirus. I want that on March 22, we thank all such people. The manner of this thanksgiving should be at 5 p.m. we stand at our doors or balconies of our houses and express, at least for 5 minutes, our thanks by clapping or beating thaalis. Local governments should alert people at 5 p.m. on Sunday. In this time of crisis, you also have to keep in mind that our hospitals are not overloaded so that they can combat coronavirus. Therefore I ask those going in for routine check-ups to avoid it, and if you need medical advise try and get it over the phone. I also request you to postpone elective surgeries. The economy is also being affected deeply by this pandemic. The Govt. of India has set up, under the FM, the setting up of a COVID-19 task force. This task force will, after due consultations with stakeholders, take decisions in a short frame of time. This pandemic has undoubtedly hit the economic situation of middle, lower-middle, and poor communities. I ask industrialists to also treat employees humanely and not cut pay of those who cant make it to work. Please remember they too need to run their homes. I also assure the country that we are taking all steps to make sure that all necessities will be available as always. Please do not do panic buying, buy as you normally would. I am confident that in the coming days you will undertake your duties and responsibilities as before. We must face this crisis with great determination.
